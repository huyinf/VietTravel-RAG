I wish there is more staff around as some visitors were being insensitive and disrespectful.

Emily Y George Town, Malaysia 17 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Busy but nice We like this place in Hanoi because not too noisy. It’s bush with lots of school kids but we like the nice buildings and the trees. It’s an old place and the culture is good. Some nice music is also playing and the fish ponds are beautiful. You should see this place if you choose to go to Hanoi.

The gentle drizzle seemed to quiet the city, soften the colors, and slow everything down. It was peaceful and serene—the lake, the iconic red bridge, and the surroundings looked absolutely stunning.

I have visited before and managed to get into the museum but because of the limited opening times it closed on this occasion. I wore a t shirt and shorts and was made to purchase a shawl to cover my shoulders before I was allowed into the open air area in front of the building. This area reminds me of a car park. I could totally understand if I was entering the building but to just walk in the area seemed very strict. Lots of people were turned away as they didn’t have the correct clothes on. So be warned. There was a guy selling them by the entrance. Would I recommend going mmmm yes to tick the box.

Me_n_my_rucksack Yorkshire, UK 6,347 contributions 1 4 of 5 bubbles New location out of town - a new modern museum well worth the visit. Importantly - this Museum has moved ! It is no longer in the middle of the city.  It is now in the suburbs a 20 to 30 min drive out of the middle of town. (Using the Grab App its still only a few pounds) Head for the Vincom Megacity Smart mall (A moders shopping Centre) and its the other side of a dual carriageway with an underpass. The new museum is large - massive comcrete multi story building with large galleries (some of which were not finished when we visited. The external displays are generally the ones which were previously displayed in the old museum in town.  As you enter the museum grounds to the left are US Aircraft and tanks, to the right Vietnamese aircraft SAMs and Radars. Fortunateley some of the political propoganda of the old museum has been toned down - after all somewhere claiming to be a Museum presents facts and artefacts not a one sided biased account.  The new museum is still a long way from being an impartial account of history but its better than the old one. When we visited the museum had been open a week, some of the galleries were empty and the escalators didnt work.  It was free for the first month and it was heaving with visitors.   The obvious bias aside this is an excellent museum displaying the tanks aircraft etc with lots of space around them and very accessable. Very well worth the trip out of the City to visit it.

So although we couldn’t go in we could walk around the outside taking in the beautiful architecture. It has a very prominent position in the centre of Hanoi.

From the crack of dawn, locals are out practicing tai chi and laughter yoga (yes, it's really a thing) around the lakes. Throughout the day they chat over iced coffee with milk at sidewalk cafés, and after the sun goes down they drink locally brewed beer at their favorite watering holes. Hanoians take pride in their legendary food scene, so they devote a great deal of time to slurping noodles in street kitchens and checking out the newest restaurants.
