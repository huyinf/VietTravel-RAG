I wish there is more staff around as some visitors were being insensitive and disrespectful.Read moreReview of: Hoa Lo PrisonWritten June 4, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Emily YGeorge Town, Malaysia17 contributions04 of 5 bubblesBusy but niceWe like this place in Hanoi because not too noisy. It’s bush with lots of school kids but we like the nice buildings and the trees. It’s an old place and the culture is good. Some nice music is also playing and the fish ponds are beautiful. You should see this place if you choose to go to Hanoi.Read moreReview of: Temple of Literature & National UniversityWritten March 31, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Ashish ABengaluru, India40 contributions04 of 5 bubblesPeaceful Hoan Kiem LakeWe visited Hoàn Kiếm Lake on a rainy day, which made the experience all the more beautiful. The gentle drizzle seemed to quiet the city, soften the colors, and slow everything down. It was peaceful and serene—the lake, the iconic red bridge, and the surroundings looked absolutely stunning.Read moreReview of: Lake of the Restored Sword (Hoan Kiem Lake)Written May 28, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] BorntocruiseUKHeathfield, UK15,297 contributions04 of 5 bubblesDon’t forget to cover your shoulders and legs!!!I have visited before and managed to get into the museum but because of the limited opening times it closed on this occasion.I wore a t shirt and shorts and was made to purchase a shawl to cover my shoulders before I was allowed into the open air area in front of the building. This area reminds me of a car park. I could totally understand if I was entering the building but to just walk in the area seemed very strict. Lots of people were turned away as they didn’t have the correct clothes on. So be warned. There was a guy selling them by the entrance.Would I recommend going mmmm yes to tick the box.Read moreReview of: Ho Chi Minh MausoleumWritten April 27, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Me_n_my_rucksackYorkshire, UK6,347 contributions14 of 5 bubblesNew location out of town - a new modern museum well worth the visit.Importantly - this Museum has moved ! It is no longer in the middle of the city.  It is now in the suburbs a 20 to 30 min drive out of the middle of town. (Using the Grab App its still only a few pounds) Head for the Vincom Megacity Smart mall (A moders shopping Centre) and its the other side of a dual carriageway with an underpass.The new museum is large - massive comcrete multi story building with large galleries (some of which were not finished when we visited.The external displays are generally the ones which were previously displayed in the old museum in town.  As you enter the museum grounds to the left are US Aircraft and tanks, to the right Vietnamese aircraft SAMs and Radars.Fortunateley some of the political propoganda of the old museum has been toned down - after all somewhere claiming to be a Museum presents facts and artefacts not a one sided biased account.  The new museum is still a long way from being an impartial account of history but its better than the old one.When we visited the museum had been open a week, some of the galleries were empty and the escalators didnt work.  It was free for the first month and it was heaving with visitors.   The obvious bias aside this is an excellent museum displaying the tanks aircraft etc with lots of space around them and very accessable.Very well worth the trip out of the City to visit it.Read moreReview of: Vietnam Military History MuseumWritten December 11, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

May be next time.You could be forgiven to thinking you were in France as the building definitely has the feel.So although we couldn’t go in we could walk around the outside taking in the beautiful architecture.It has a very prominent position in the centre of Hanoi.Read moreReview of: Hanoi Opera HouseWritten April 27, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
