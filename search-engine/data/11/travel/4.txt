Dau Dang Waterfall Dau Dang Waterfall is a stunning natural attraction located within Ba Be National Park, Ba Be District, Bac Kan Province, about 16 kilometers from the town of Cho Ra. The waterfall is nestled between two limestone mountain ranges and features a steep drop. The Ngan River, which flows through this area, is blocked by a series of large and small rocks, cascading over a height of 500 meters, creating a spectacular waterfall. The surrounding pristine forest enhances the breathtaking beauty of the scene. Dau Dang Waterfall lies on the Ngan River, marking the border between Bac Kan and Tuyen Quang Provinces. As the Ngan River passes beneath the limestone cliffs of Lung Nham, it creates the Puong Cave, and further downstream, near the Hua Tang village, large rocks block the river's path, forming the waterfall. The waterfall stretches over 1,000 meters and is divided into three levels, with a height difference of about 3 to 4 meters between each level. This awe-inspiring natural wonder is surrounded by lush forests and is home to a rare species of fish, the catfish, with some individuals weighing over 10 kilograms. Visitors can enjoy stunning views of the waterfall from large stone slabs or from the wooden balcony built higher up on the cliffside.

This ancient natural cave has been recognized as a national historical site since 1999. According to local legend, seven fairies descended from the heavens to admire the beauty of a stream at the foot of Phia Trang Mountain. Enchanted by the picturesque scenery, they lost track of time and as night fell, they were unable to return to the sky. Seeking refuge, they ran into the forest, where the heavens, moved by compassion, created a cave for them to shelter overnight. The cave was thus named Fairy Cave. From a distance, the cave resembles a young maiden lying peacefully in slumber. Visitors can reach the cave by climbing 132 stone steps, leading to a large, dome-shaped rock resembling a turtle shell. The rock is covered in dense vegetation, with an entrance at the bottom. Stepping inside, the contrast between the bright light outside and the darkness within gives visitors the sensation of entering another world. The cool, misty air and the sound of trickling water immediately create a peaceful and magical atmosphere. As visitors continue deeper into the cave, the environment becomes quieter and cooler, providing a serene escape from the outside world.

Fairy Pond When exploring Ba Be Lake, visitors must not miss the serene Fairy Pond , which floats gracefully on the crystal-clear water. Looking towards the setting sun, one can spot a rocky ridge rising high. According to legend, this is where the celestial beings played chess. Following this trail and climbing about 200 meters uphill, you will arrive at the Fairy Pond. The pond is round, covering an area of over 1,000 square meters, and it is separated from the lake with no inlet or outlet, making its water crystal clear and still. The Fairy Pond is located at the far end of Ba Be Lake, nestled within a valley surrounded by untouched primary forests. There are underground springs that connect the Fairy Pond with Ba Be Lake. The pond, which spans approximately 3 hectares, sits atop a mountain and is encircled by tropical rainforest, offering a cool and refreshing atmosphere.

Hua Mạ Cave According to local legend, the ancient Ma Forest was once haunted by spirits. A royal officer, passing through, heard the eerie wails of vengeful souls—soldiers who had died fighting for the throne but had not found peace. The officer set up camp by the Lèng River and performed a ritual, offering the head of a horse as a sacrifice to the heavens. After the ceremony, the haunting cries ceased. Over time, spectacular stalactites and stalagmites formed, and the cave became known as Hua Mạ Cave , or locally, Horse Head Cave . The cave is located at the base of Cô Đơn Mountain, 350 meters above sea level. A series of steps leads from the base to the entrance, which is 300 meters up the mountain. The entrance itself is 3 meters wide and 5 meters high. Inside, the cave spans about 1 hectare, stretching over 700 meters. Its ceiling rises to 40-50 meters in places, with awe-inspiring formations of stalactites and stalagmites. Some formations resemble objects like a pen tower, a lotus flower, or even scenes from the classic Chinese tale of Journey to the West. Many believe that Hua Mạ Cave is one of the most extraordinary caves in Vietnam. Address: Quảng Khê Commune, Ba Bể District, Bac Kan Province Hua Mạ Cave Hua Mạ Cave 11. Nà Khoang Waterfall Nà Khoang Waterfall is located about 6 kilometers from Nà Phặc town center, at the foot of the Gió Pass, next to National Route 3. The waterfall area covers around 12 hectares.

The combined water cascades down a 600-meter, four-tiered waterfall with an average width of 15 meters, eventually flowing into the Bản Mạch stream. Above the falls, there is a crystal-clear pond perfect for swimming. The surrounding area is mostly regenerated forest, with a canopy cover of 75 to 85%, and home to a variety of wildlife including birds, squirrels, reptiles, and fish.

Thắm Temple Thắm Temple is dedicated to the legendary female general, Thắm, who played a pivotal role in the resistance against the Black Flag Army in the late 19th century. Originally, the temple honored the Mountain and Water deities for safe navigation of boats. However, in the late 1800s, it was renovated to also honor General Thắm , who was instrumental in defeating the Black Flag forces. The temple complex consists of the main temple, the shrine of General Thắm, and the Mountain God shrine. The main temple houses several revered figures, including the Five Deities, Bách Linh, General Trần Hưng Đạo, the Heavenly Mother, and the Goddess of Mercy. Adjacent to the main temple is the shrine of General Thắm , a concrete structure with an arched roof, featuring a statue of Thắm in a blue robe, flanked by stone phoenix sculptures. A local legend tells of an elderly fisherman and his son living by the Tràng Cổ river. One year, floods destroyed their boat and nets. When the waters receded, the old man cast his net, only to haul in a strange stone. Despite the oddity, he continued to catch the same stone, until one day it spoke: “Take me home.” The fisherman did so, and upon resting the stone, it cracked open to reveal gold inside, which the fisherman shared with the villagers. In gratitude, the locals built a temple to honor the two stones as Mountain and Water deities, ensuring safe passage for boats.

Ba Bể Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Vietnam and has been designated as a National Special Relic. It is also recognized by the World Freshwater Conference as one of the 20 most significant freshwater lakes in the world that need to be protected. Located at an elevation of approximately 145 meters above sea level, the lake spans around 500 hectares and is surrounded by limestone mountains, many of which contain caves and hidden springs. The scenic view of the lake is often described as a breathtaking watercolor painting, captivating visitors throughout history. Ba Bể Lake was formed over 200 million years ago during the Southeast Asian tectonic activity at the end of the Cambrian period. A massive body of water, spanning approximately 5 million square meters and over 30 meters deep, was pushed up to the mountainside, creating Ba Bể Lake. The lake consists of three interconnected branches: Pé Lầm, Pé Lù, and Pé Lèng. Its greatest value lies in its unique geological features, exceptional geomorphological importance, and immense biodiversity. It is the largest natural freshwater lake in Vietnam. In 1995, Ba Bể Lake was recognized by the World Freshwater Conference, held in the United States, as one of the 20 most important freshwater lakes in need of global protection. In late 2004, Ba Bể National Park was designated as an ASEAN Heritage Park. On September 27, 2012, the Prime Minister of Vietnam issued Decision No. 1419/QD-TTg, officially declaring Ba Bể Lake a National Special Relic.
