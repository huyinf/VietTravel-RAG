The soybeans grown in Binh Long soil are round, shiny, and uniform. Among the tofu-making steps, boiling the filtered soybean water with vinegar is crucial.

The meat is thoroughly washed and filtered, thinly sliced, then mixed with finely chopped garlic, ground pepper, white wine, and fragrant roasted rice powder.
[P] Once the ingredients for wrapping nem are prepared, the nem pieces are carefully wrapped in banana leaves and guava leaves. The inner layer is usually made of bitter guava leaves, providing a suitable bitter taste, while the outer layer serves as a protective coat made of fresh banana leaves. The nem are wrapped just right, not too tightly, to allow for fermentation and prolonged preservation. Using banana leaves to wrap nem creates a fresh green color and a glossy appearance.

It has a similar shape to regular spinach but with larger, softer, and plumper stems. People often use the stems and young leaves of water spinach for cooking. It has a distinctive fresh taste, so when cooking, people often blanch the leaves to reduce the flavor. However, its deliciousness always makes people crave and forget about its slightly pungent smell.
[P] The flavor ofwater spinachis truly unique. It is not to be confused with other wild greens; it's a harmonious blend of earthy, foresty aromas, and the purity of the highland air. The most notable aspect of this dish is its somewhat... fresh aroma. Therefore, when preparing this dish, one must blanch the leaves to lessen the pungent smell. Despite this, when eaten, one cannot entirely avoid a slight lingering aroma. We can easily liken it to the experience after eating shrimp paste vermicelli, similarly, after eating water spinach, it's just the degree of “fragrance” that differs.
