Legend has it that while searching for the capital land, the Hung Kings and the courtiers of Van Lang kingdom set foot in a land with 99 hills and 99 streams. While admiring the beauty here, they witnessed two golden buffaloes fiercely fighting, then suddenly both plunged into the water and disappeared. Since then, the pond has been called the Golden Buffalo Lake. 'Ao Chau Pond is both deep and cool, Both shores are covered with lush greenery.' With an area of ​​about 1500 hectares, Ao Chau Pond spreads out in a serene azure blue, encompassed by water, sky, and lush foliage. The hilly terrain has created hundreds of streams meandering through the areas, with many beautiful waterfalls pouring into the pond. Thanks to the year-round water retention and absence of drought, it creates conditions for natural vegetation to thrive, mainly consisting of ferns, sedges, rushes, tea, and low shrubs… Some hillsides are later covered with grass, lotus ponds, pine trees, and on some islands, locals have planted fruit trees such as lychee, longan, jackfruit, and pomelo… Address: Ha Hoa, Phu Tho Scenic Beauty of Ao Chau Pond Ao Chau Pond 3.

Mother Goddess Au Co Temple Located on the blessed land of great significance, Mother Goddess Au Co Temple is a remarkable cultural-historical monument, symbolizing the spirit of patriotism and the tradition of national unity.

The Mother Goddess Au Co Temple is situated in Hien Luong commune, Ha Hoa district, and was built during the Later Le dynasty. Legend has it that Au Co gave birth to a hundred eggs, which hatched into a hundred sons. As the sons grew up, Lac Long Quan said to Au Co: I am of the Dragon lineage, you are of the Fairy lineage, water and fire are difficult to reconcile. Therefore, the two divided the fifty sons of the mother up the mountain and fifty sons of the father down to the sea to perpetuate the lineage, and later all hundred sons of both of them became deities. Mother Au Co once visited the land that is now Hien Luong, Ha Hoa district, Son Tay prefecture, where she taught her descendants to cultivate rice, plant strawberries, raise silkworms, and weave fabric. When the settlement in Hien Luong became stable and prosperous, Mother Au Co and her descendants ventured to explore new lands. Later, she decided to return to live with Hien Luong, the place most closely associated with her life. According to tradition, on the 25th day of the 12th lunar month in the year of the Rat, Mother Au Co and her fairies flew to heaven, leaving behind a strip of silk under a banyan tree. Later, the local people erected a temple to worship and commemorate her contributions to the Vietnamese nation. Today, the Au Co Mother Temple Festival is still held annually on the eve of the 7th day of the first lunar month.
