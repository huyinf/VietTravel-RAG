This city captures the hearts of visitors through their stomachs. You could spend two weeks just eating out without repeating a single dish. Here’s a guide to 12 signature foods you absolutely must try to get the full experience. 1. Com Tam Com tam , or broken rice, is the beating heart of Saigonese cuisine—a dish so iconic you simply can’t leave the city without trying it. Whether for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a midnight craving, this flexible dish always delivers. The classic combo includes grilled pork chop, shredded pork skin, steamed egg meatloaf, and a sunny-side-up egg atop fragrant, broken rice. It’s usually served with pickled veggies and a drizzle of sweet-savory fish sauce. Add some scallion oil and crispy pork fat, and you’ve got yourself a heavenly bite. Best enjoyed with a cold drink in a bustling local eatery. Where to eat: Com Tam Moc (85 Ly Tu Trong): 95,000 VND ($3.65, 1 USD ≈ 26,000 VND) Com Tam Chi Hang (28 Do Quang Dau): 82,000 VND 2. Banh Mi Banh mi isn’t just a sandwich; it’s a full-on flavor explosion in a crispy baguette. With its roots in French colonial times, this Vietnamese sandwich has evolved into something truly unique. The crusty bread holds an endless mix of fillings—cold cuts, pate, grilled meat, fried egg, or even sardines—topped with pickled carrots, cucumbers, coriander, and a splash of soy or chili sauce. It’s perfect for on-the-go munching. Some vendors even offer vegetarian options, so feel free to ask (and if they don’t have it, chances are they’ll point you to someone who does). Where to eat: Banh Mi Huynh Hoa (26 Le Thi Rieng): 68,000 VND Banh Mi Pho Co 159 (31/1 Ton That Tung): 49,000 VND 3. Banh Xeo Watching banh xeo cook is half the fun. These crispy golden pancakes are made in large, sizzling pans, with a batter of rice flour, turmeric, and coconut milk. The filling—shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts—is folded inside the thin, crackling shell. But that’s just the beginning. Wrap it in mustard greens or lettuce, add fresh herbs, and dip it in tangy fish sauce for a bite that’s crunchy, savory, and fresh all at once. It’s a communal dish that invites sharing, storytelling, and the pure joy of messy, delicious eating. Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty—it’s part of the banh xeo fun. Where to eat: Hoang Tam Restaurant (TK22/1 Nguyen Canh Chan): 179,000 VND Banh Xeo An Ghien (74 Suong Nguyet Anh): 85,000 VND 4. Goi Cuon & Bo Bia When you want something light but full of flavor, goi cuon and bo bia (spring rolls & Chinese-style spring rolls) are your go-to. These fresh rolls are wrapped in soft rice paper and packed with herbs, vermicelli noodles, pork, and shrimp for the former, or Chinese sausage with jicama for the latter. They’re refreshing, low-calorie, and served with a thick, savory peanut-hoisin dipping sauce that takes them to the next level. Perfect as an afternoon snack, a starter, or a healthy bite between sightseeing stops. Where to eat: This is a popular street food priced at 10,000–20,000 VND per roll. You’ll find it at markets and sidewalk vendors all over the city. 5. Bo Ne You want steak and eggs? We have them—served to you still sizzling. Bo ne features thin slices of beef, often paired with egg, pate, sausage, or even meatballs, all cooking on a hot cast iron skillet. The name “ne” (meaning “to dodge”) comes from dodging the hot oil splatters! Served with a baguette or French fries to soak up the juicy sauces, it’s hearty, indulgent, and truly delicious. Add a bit of chili sauce, fresh tomato slices, and cucumber on the side for the full experience. Ideal for brunch or a protein-packed dinner with a twist of local flair. Where to eat: Bo Ne Ba Ngon (18 Dinh Tien Hoang): 68,000 VND Bo Ne Ba Nui (94 Nguyen Thai Binh): 68,000 VND 6. Hu Tieu If you want to dive into southern Vietnam’s noodle culture, start with hu tieu . The chewy, clear noodles bathe in a sweet-savory broth made from pork bones and daikon. You can go for the dry version with sauce or the classic soupy style. Toppings vary from sliced pork, shrimp, and quail eggs to crispy shallots and greens. Versions like hu tieu Sadec , hu tieu My Tho , and hu tieu Nam Vang (Phnom Penh style), each tied to a specific city, add an exciting twist to the dish. You’ll find legendary hu tieu shops run by generations of the same family, each with its own secret recipe. Where to eat: Hu Tieu Thanh Xuan My Tho (62 Ton That Thiep): 75,000 VND Hu Tieu Nhan Quan (122D Cach Mang Thang Tam): 90,000 VND 7. Bun Rieu Bun rieu is absolutely not for the faint of heart. This tangy, tomato-based broth is layered with crab paste, tofu, tomatoes, and sometimes snails or pork. The rieu (crab mixture) is made by grinding crabs into a paste and simmering it until it forms tender, fluffy clumps. Served with thin rice vermicelli noodles, fresh herbs, shredded banana blossom, and a squeeze of lime, this dish hits the spot—especially on a rainy day. Where to eat: Bun Rieu Ganh Cho Ben Thanh (163 Le Thanh Ton): 65,000 VND Bun Rieu Goc (TK18/5 Nguyen Canh Chan): 75,000 VND 8. Bun Mam Bun mam is one of the specialties of Southern Vietnam, featuring a broth made from fermented fish. To prepare it, the fermented fish sauce is boiled, the bones are removed to extract the liquid, and then shallots, lemongrass, eggplant, and spices are added. A bowl of bun mam typically includes thick rice vermicelli, shrimp, squid, grilled pork, and eggplant. It’s usually served with a variety of vegetables like shredded water spinach, bitter herbs, and water lily stems. Where to eat: Bun Mam Mien Tay (124 Tran Khac Chan): 50,000 VND Di Sau Mien Tay (25/22 Ton That Tung): 59,000 VND 9. Bun Thit Nuong Don’t overlook this flavor-packed dry noodle dish. Bun thit nuong is a beautiful bowl of grilled pork, vermicelli noodles, fresh herbs, pickled vegetables, and crispy spring rolls, all brought together with a sweet-sour fish sauce dressing. It’s a light yet filling meal that’s perfect for Saigon’s tropical heat. Every element adds something: smokiness from the meat, crunch from the rolls, and freshness from the greens. Stir it up for a mouthful of texture and flavor in every bite. Where to eat: Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (01 Nguyen Trung Truc): 70,000 VND Quan Bun Thit Nuong (88 Mac Dinh Chi): 48,000 VND 10. Oc Eating shellfish in Saigon isn’t just about food—it’s an experience. From stir-fried snails to grilled oysters, clams steamed with lemongrass to scallops with green onion oil, each bite bursts with bold seasoning. Oc joints are often crowded, lively places where friends gather over beer, laughter, and endless small plates. There’s even an entire street—Vinh Khanh in District 4—dedicated to this seafood. Don’t be shy about trying new varieties or dipping everything into sweet tamarind or salted egg yolk sauce. Order a cold beer and just like that, you’re experiencing Saigon’s night scene like a true local. Where to eat: This street food favorite can be found along lively streets like Bui Vien (District 1) and Vinh Khanh (District 4). 11. Xoi Man You want something for breakfast, dinner, or post-party hunger? Xoi man , please! Xoi man , savory sticky rice, is Saigon’s ultimate comfort food. Made with glutinous rice and topped with sausage, pork floss, pickled radish, quail eggs, and slices of pork roll, it’s a complete meal in one portable package. Often wrapped in banana leaves to lock in flavor, this dish is especially popular among night owls and early risers alike. Whether you’re recovering from a late night or grabbing something to-go before exploring the city, xoi man has your back with its warm, savory goodness. Where to eat: This popular street food is priced at 15,000–30,000 VND. You’ll find it at street stalls and sidewalk vendors all over the city. 12. Ca Phe Sua Da We’re ending this list with a drink that helped put Saigon on the map: ca phe sua da . This bold blend of Vietnamese coffee and sweetened condensed milk poured over ice is the drink that fuels the city. Locals sip it slowly at sidewalk cafes while people-watching or chatting with friends. It’s versatile enough to pair with any meal and gives you that perfect energy kick. Don’t forget to stir well before sipping for that creamy finish. Whether you’re new to coffee or a die-hard fan, this drink will leave a lasting impression—and probably start a new addiction. Where to try: Ca phe sua da is so popular in Ho Chi Minh City that you can find it on nearly every street corner, with prices typically ranging from 15,000–50,000 VND.
