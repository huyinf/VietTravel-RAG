[P] Ho Chi Minh City is a paradise for food lovers, where every street corner offers a delicious surprise. This city captures the hearts of visitors through their stomachs. You could spend two weeks just eating out without repeating a single dish. Here’s a guide to 12 signature foods you absolutely must try to get the full experience.
[H2] 1. Com Tam
[P] Com tam, or broken rice, is the beating heart of Saigonese cuisine—a dish so iconic you simply can’t leave the city without trying it. Whether for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a midnight craving, this flexible dish always delivers. The classic combo includes grilled pork chop, shredded pork skin, steamed egg meatloaf, and a sunny-side-up egg atop fragrant, broken rice.
