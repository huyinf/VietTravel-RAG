                                    view From April to June Bach Long salt field. If you have the opportunity to visit the Bach Long salt field in Nam Dinh, you will witness the white image from the large salt fields, besides the players are passionately working hard. These are also the characteristics that have created a separate attraction for this place and attracts a lot of people to visit.
Bach Long salt field is located in Bach Long commune, Giao Thuy district, Nam Dinh province. Bach Long commune is one of the largest salt fields in the North with an area of ​​up to 230ha. Since ancient times, this place was a land built by the beach, then people from every region came to live, establishing the village before even the French colonialists invaded. To this day, salt making has officially become a traditional profession of the people in Bach Long commune with more than 1,000 households participating. Because the natural location is located in the coast, this place cannot grow rice, and has the strength of a rich source of salt water, so the salt making becomes extremely developed. Bach Long salt fields are also in the top of the most beautiful salt fields in the North, so many tourists want to visit. To choose the favorable time to visit the Bach Long salt field, it will certainly be from March until the end of August each year, because this is the salt making season of the people here. Coming here on these days, you will witness the fiery sun and the enthusiastic images of the matches, the reason is because the bigger the sunshine, the faster the salt crystallizes and makes the people's harvest more convenient. To make pure white salt seeds is not simple at all, but it must be a strange process. Right from the early morning, many matches had to be present in the field of White Dragon salt and often ended the work when it was late. The way to make salt here is also very special, instead of making salt by the steam method like the South or the Central, the salt in the North is made by the method of drying on the sand. In many other salt fields, the matches just need to scoop the sea and dry, but with the white dragon fruits will need one more step to dry and filter the sand. The reason is that Giao Thuy sea is located near the river mouth, so the salinity concentration is low, so it is necessary to dry the sand and filter sand to increase the salinity concentration. First at 6 am, the match will start soaking sand with sea water, making soil. In the field, there will be rectangular plots to smooth the surface, pour the sand to absorb water, sometimes adding seawater to increase salinity. When the sun rises and after many hours, the sea will evaporate and the salt will crystallize on the sand surface. Continuing the sea water will be led from the sea to filter the sand through the sand and then flow into the child, through the system. The matches will now take the gourd water from the mainstream and pour it on the drying yard with cement like the chessboard boxes. Small umbrellas are 2 elected, large umbrellas 3-4. At this time, the match will take advantage of rest and return to work at 1 pm. This is also the time when the sand has been dried, each grain has crystallized into small white salt seeds. The salt population will collect salt into beds, scooped on a wheelbarrier and pushed them to the warehouse. Salt will be preserved and wait for traders to buy. 
It is true that we have to go to witness, we can feel all the difficulties and hardships of salt making. If you have the opportunity to travel to Nam Dinh, do not forget to visit the field of Bach Long salt to experience the salt making process of the people here. Nam Dinh 925
