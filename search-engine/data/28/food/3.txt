Fermented pork roll comes in many shapes, depending on the appearance and method of preparation, it can be long, square, cylindrical, or 'thinh' (a specific shape in Vietnamese cuisine). The main ingredients for making Thanh Hoa's fermented pork roll specialty are pork butt meat, fig leaves, guava leaves, 'thinh' (a kind of toasted rice powder), and spices such as chili, sliced garlic. Some places even add pork skin to make it less greasy. Fermented pork roll is made from raw meat that undergoes fermentation, so it may be difficult to eat for some people, but those who have tried it will surely be addicted. The pork is chewy, sour, accompanied by fragrant 'thinh'. Locals often enjoy fermented pork roll with chili sauce or garlic fish sauce.

Lam Sweet Soup Phu Quang Phu Quang Sweet Soup is a Thanh Hoa specialty known affectionately as the 'countryside gift'. This type of sweet soup is named after the Vinh Loc district of the past.

Roasted peanuts are peeled and crushed finely. Phu Quang Sweet Soup has a beautiful golden color, best enjoyed with tea, combining rustic charm with a hint of sophistication. The bitterness of the tea blends with the sweetness of sugarcane, the nuttiness of roasted peanuts, and the fragrant stickiness of glutinous rice, all in a very natural way.
