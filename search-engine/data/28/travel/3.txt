Ho Dynasty Citadel This is the starting point of the Central Vietnam Heritage Trail, where you can visit the impressive Ho Dynasty Citadel, a testament to the reign of King Ho Quy Ly. Despite the passage of over 600 years, with both historical upheaval and natural wear, the outer walls of the citadel remain remarkably intact. The fortress is constructed from finely crafted green limestone blocks, measuring around 1.5 meters long and some reaching as high as 6 meters, weighing several tons. These stone blocks are tightly stacked without any binding agents, standing firm through the ages. Built during a pivotal time in Vietnamese history, marked by significant reforms of the Ho dynasty and the drive to protect national independence, the Ho Dynasty Citadel is a key cultural landmark of a civilization that, though brief, left an enduring legacy. When you visit, don't forget to try the famous 'Che Lam Phu Quang' — a crunchy sweet made from sticky rice, molasses, peanuts, and ginger — along with a refreshing cup of green tea. Ho Dynasty Citadel 2. Cẩm Lương Sacred Fish Stream Thanh Hoa is a region renowned for its breathtaking natural landscapes. One of the most iconic spiritual and ecological destinations in this land of the Ma River’s folk songs is the Cẩm Lương Sacred Fish Stream . This stream is a true marvel of nature, famous not only for its untouched beauty but also for the mysterious legends surrounding it. Located at the foot of the Truong Sinh Mountain, this clear stream is home to thousands of fish, and is intertwined with the fascinating local stories passed down by the villagers. Near the stream, you can also find the beautiful Cây Đăng Cave, filled with stunning stalactites. Additionally, if you're lucky, you might spot a giant fish weighing up to 30kg. Despite the large number of fish packed together, the water remains remarkably clear. Be sure to visit the Cẩm Lương Sacred Fish Stream in Thanh Hoa to enjoy the fresh mountain air and immerse yourself in the region's enchanting tales and unique local specialties!

The road to Pù Luông, whether coming from Hanoi or Thanh Hoa, is easily accessible, even the winding mountain paths. A visit to Pù Luông means stepping into a world of villages surrounded by terraced rice fields, lush green forests, rolling mountain ranges, and refreshing streams and waterfalls. Waking up early to walk through the fields, feeling the misty clouds embrace you, and gently brushing your hands through dewy rice stalks, are rare moments of peace you won't often find in your everyday life. Another amazing experience here is when the first warm rays of sunlight touch your skin, as you observe the simple, tranquil life of the locals. In the paradise of Pù Luông, you’ll often witness clouds and mist drifting lazily through the valleys before rising into the sky, mirrored by infinity pools that enhance the dreamy landscape.

A boat ride on the river while savoring dishes made from local fish, as well as exploring the customs and traditions of the Thai people, provides memorable experiences at Bến En. Early morning boat rides, when the islands are still shrouded in mist, offer a surreal feeling, as if entering a magical world of water, clouds, and sky. Among the 21 islands, many are poetically named: Love, Happiness, Twin Mountains, and Hope. It’s no wonder that those who have visited Bến En affectionately call it the “Ha Long Bay on land” of Thanh Hoa. While leisurely exploring the lake, you can venture into the forest where you’ll be captivated by the vibrant banana trees in full bloom, monkeys leaping from tree to tree to drink from the lake, and the symphony of birdsong creating a beautiful chorus of the ancient forest. From a distance, you may catch sight of the smoke rising from the Mường and Thai villages, warming the quiet mountain air. Bến En National Park 5. Đông Sơn Ancient Village Đông Sơn Village was once part of Đông Giang commune, Đông Sơn district (Thanh Hoa), and is now located in Hàm Rồng ward, Thanh Hoa city. This ancient village is famous not only in Thanh Hoa but throughout Vietnam. The name Đông Sơn has been known by many Western scholars since the last century. Situated on the southern bank of the Ma River, near the legendary Hàm Rồng Bridge, Đông Sơn embodies all the classic features of a traditional Vietnamese village. The village’s layout is centered around agricultural life, with fields of rice and hilly terrain. The system of cultural landmarks, such as the communal house, pagoda, and shrine, are thoughtfully positioned, creating a harmonious scene with familiar sights like the roof of the communal house and the village well. Few villages in Vietnam have a history as long and continuous as Đông Sơn . The village is considered a 'living chronicle,' reflecting the ongoing development of Vietnamese society from the time of the Hung Kings to the present. Its history is deeply intertwined with the many ups and downs of Thanh Hoa's land and people over the centuries. Đông Sơn Ancient Village 6.

The surroundings are still quite untouched, with fresh, crystal-clear waters flowing under the canopy of forest trees, offering a refreshing experience. According to local elders, the story goes that when General Quang Trung Nguyễn Huệ marched north, he came across a large water source in the forest during his crossing of the Tam Điệp mountain range. He allowed his war elephants to bathe in the water, and after refreshing themselves, the elephants trumpeted loudly, echoing through the mountains. The water source, which had no name at the time, became known as Hốc Voi, and later, the waterfall area was named Elephant Waterfall . Today, this site is truly an appealing destination for travelers. Standing under the powerful waterfall, feeling the cool spray, is a refreshing experience amidst the enchanting natural surroundings. The cascading water forms a frothy mist, and the constant roar of the waterfall sounds like a dragon spouting water.
