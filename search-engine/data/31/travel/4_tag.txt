[H3] 2. Discover rural life of Quang Binh

Outside the main tourist areas, small villages are dotted across the countryside, where people still farm and live in much the same way as they have for generations. Exploring these areas gives travelers a true off-the-beaten-path experience.
[P] To explore rural Quang Binh, renting a motorbike is one of the best ways to get around. The roads are generally quiet, and the scenery is breathtaking.

Though much of the original structure has been damaged over time, the remaining walls and gates still stand as a reminder of the city’s turbulent history.
[P] Tam Toa Church: This Catholic church is a poignant symbol of the destruction caused by the Vietnam War.
