It offers a glimpse into the daily life of locals and showcases traditional Vietnamese market features like sampan landings and bustling bazaars. Visitors can indulge in iconic Hue dishes such as beef noodle soup and mussel rice while exploring souvenir items, bronze goods, and local delicacies like sesame sweetmeats.

Worth a visit if you’re visiting in Hue for an authentic market experience. Ezra C — Google review ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars)
Dong Ba Market: A Vibrant Hue Experience (and Great Shopping!)
While you are exploring the bustling markets of Vietnam, Dong Ba Market in Hue is definitely worth a visit.  It's a sprawling market offering everything from fresh produce and local delicacies to clothing, souvenirs, and everything in between.  It's a sensory overload in the best way possible!
Be prepared to haggle – it's all part of the fun!  The vendors are generally friendly, though some can be a bit pushy, but that's typical of markets like this.  It's a great opportunity to practice your bargaining skills and potentially snag some great deals.
My partner was particularly interested in finding some local handicrafts and she was not disappointed. She found a couple of beautiful bracelets, intricately designed and reasonably priced after a bit of friendly negotiation.  She also managed to find a stylish purse that she absolutely loves.  The variety of designs and materials available was impressive.
Beyond the shopping, Dong Ba Market is a fantastic place to experience the local culture and atmosphere.  It's a vibrant and lively place, full of sights, sounds, and smells.  You can wander through the different sections, sample some local snacks, and observe the daily life of the Hue people.  It's a great way to immerse yourself in the local culture.
While it can be a bit overwhelming at times, Dong Ba Market is a must-visit for anyone looking for a genuine market experience in Hue.  Just be prepared to bargain, and you'll likely find some treasures to take home with you.  Recommended for shopping and experiencing the vibrant local atmosphere! Mark D — Google review This is an amazing market, seems everything is here, quite big!  Upstairs are clothing, bags and silks. We don’t have a very good experience up there,  they were very pushy! A lady meet us on the stairs asking us to have a look at her clothing, told her we’re not looking anything in particular just having a look around. But she won’t have it, they will put anything you might be interested in your face! She was getting rude when I wasn’t buying. Price start really high!

Another woman won’t let you passed by until they shoved anything they’re  selling on your face! They repeat what you saying in a rude way!

Downstairs all food, plenty of dry fruits, nuts, anything you can think of and in all different sections. Quite pleasant to look around here because they won’t bother you that much unless you ask! Helpful to have google for translation, most of sellers won’t understand English. Great experience. LALAAG A — Google review Incredible authentic Vietnamese market experience. Such delicious fruit and veg stalls on the outside and inside there is everything you could imagine piled around! walking round can be a little overwhelming but such an amazing experience, lots of very cool and interesting items! famous bun bo hue Anthony bourdain visit is inside the market. Definitely worth a visit while in Hue!! Lauren S — Google review Very authentic vietnamese market. Easy to get some of the more authentic snack foods, e.g, Nem Chua and snails. Coffee was like rocket fuel. Gav G — Google review Really enjoyable to walk around and most folks are friendly to foreigners. You can see a lot of items sold in the citadel gift stores for 1/10 the price. There are some street food stalls in the center and fresh juice as well! Jolee E — Google review Large indoor market with hundreds of shops that start to open slowly around 7-9am. Be prepared to be strongly solicited for your business. Feel free to negotiate with the prices. Start at 60% of the quoted prices and reach a compromise. Mustan B — Google review Hue was our third stop during a Vietnam tour, and we visited Dong Ba Market for lunch. To our surprise, our guide brought us to the Hue Lady food stall, made famous by Anthony Bourdain.
It was exciting to see Bourdain’s photo with the local food icon. However, the experience didn’t quite live up to expectations. The seating was uncomfortable, it was hot and humid, and being an open market, there were some hygiene concerns — including seeing a rodent in the area.
The Hue Lady was working alone, preparing and serving food while cleaning up as well. We had three dishes: fried vegetables with shrimp, a chicken skewer, and bún bò Huế. The first two were okay, but the bún bò Huế was disappointing — missing key ingredients like pork shank and pork blood, and not what we’d hoped for after seeing the Bourdain episode.
Would I go back? Probably not. While it’s interesting for fans of Bourdain to visit and explore the market, I’d recommend having lunch at a more comfortable and cleaner spot nearby. Bill I — Google review 02 Trần Hưng Đạo, Phú Hoà, Huế, Thành phố Huế, Vietnam • http://chodongba.com.vn/ • +84 234 3523 991 • Tips and more reviews for Dong Ba Market 2 Bánh Canh Nam Phổ Save 3.3 ( 159 ) • 5.0 ( 3 ) • Mentioned on 4 lists Restaurant Bánh Canh Nam Phổ, located in Phu Vang district, Thua Thien Hue, may not be as widely known as other local dishes, but it has its own dedicated fan base. This crab thick noodle soup is a favorite among many tourists who visit the former Citadel. Despite not being as famous as other dishes in the area, Bánh Canh Nam Phổ attracts visitors to small diners and mobile stalls where it is served every evening. Very delicious and fresh made local food like Loc. tasty indeed and big plate that’s filling, the flour and ingredients are flavourful and plenty. The bowl of soup noodles is good too. For 60k or so a plate and the noodles 30k a bowl, the price is cheaper than city centre and worth it for tourist visiting. Not too sure at first which food to order and more pictures good. Tan K — Google review Very popular at lunchtime, i went alone and shared a table with a local couple. The ladies running the place seemed nice. You sit down and they take your order, and you can try some local delicacies here that are good quality!

I ordered the bánh canh for 25k and my favorite, a plate of bánh lọc.

Bánh canh is a viscous and comforting tapioca noodle soup. This one is a small portion, with chopped up noodles and cute little meatballs. Eat it with a spoon, it was delicious.

Bánh lọc is like a tapioca dumpling wrapped in a banana leaf and filled with shrimp and pork belly. It's delicious here, and served with a salty and spicy fish sauce. I enjoyed the ones here a lot, but it was a lot to order for one person! Ninjanugets123 — Google review Really good food. All of it. Service was quick and kind. Would definitely recommend for banh quan and similar dishes. Anthony P — Google review Good traditional Hue food. 20k for a Bánh
Canh and 30k for a dish of 7 Bánh Lọc. Open at 11 am. I would go again. Thanh L — Google review The dishes are local and special, but the price is for tourists (about 20-40k per dish). The soup with noodles is quite good! Eunice C — Google review So so. Not too special. They lost 2 stars from me be cause I ordered a full dish of rice cakes but they said only 1 small order they did not want to steam it so only sell what they have Philip L — Google review Amazing Hue food! Local vibe and good taste Hoang V — Google review Banh Canh nam pho here costs 25.000vnd which is crazily expensive. The steamed prawn cake is 60.000vnd per plate is costly. It was small and not really special. Because I could not find the street vendors to buy so when I had a desire for banh Canh, I had to stop here. If i have had a chance, I would not have chosen this restaurant!

Despite its unassuming appearance, this cozy and relaxed spot is renowned for serving a wide variety of sweet soups and fruit drinks. With over 36 variations available, it offers one of the most extensive selections of sweet soups in the region. Each type boasts its own unique taste and comes in an array of ingredients and colors. We have been here for ice cream many times. It was always very good. This time is a time for lunch. It did not disappoint! Excellent local Huế food. Mr. M — Google review I ordered “ chè heo quay”( roasted pork sweet soup) and chè thập cẩm( mixed beans sweet soup). Overall, it was ok, both of them were too sweet for me. The roasted pork balls had thick tapioca skin covered, i wish it was thinner.
Interesting! Cherry N — Google review Came here for their special sweet soup with pork. It is one with sweet gingery soup and savory pork dumplings. First very shocking combination but it is ine of those specialities which the more you eat the better it becomes. An experience for the ones who dare to cross their comfort zone. It won't be a hit for everyone though. Nagy B — Google review We were here early right before opening, had 2x Che for 45k, nice and not too sweet 😊 Son V — Google review 15K for dessert. Red bean and the coconut lychee were delicious. You have to try the pork flavoured one. Thank you! Penelope J — Google review Busy local spot with fantastic Che...Try Chè khoai môn, a Vietnamese taro dessert. Its creamy texture and purple hue come from taro, which is the star ingredient. It's the purple one (the middle one of the three pics at the bottom of their menu board) - AMAZING! Damien L — Google review Typical Vietnamese desert, a delicious experience that is a must do when you come to Hue Nico L — Google review I'm not usually a fan of Che ... At all.

Lu L — Google review 1 kiệt, 29 Hùng Vương, Phú Hội, Huế, Thành phố Huế, Vietnam • https://www.foody.vn/hue/che-hem • Tips and more reviews for Chè Hẻm 4 Bánh Bèo Khay Save 4.6 ( 22 ) • Mentioned on 3 lists Bistro Bánh Bèo Khay is a popular Vietnamese dish that consists of small steamed rice-flour cakes topped with spices, shrimp flakes, and pork crackling. These individual plates are served on a tray and are meant to be enjoyed with sweetened nuoc mam sauce. Similar dishes like bánh nam and bánh lam offer variations using manioc flour and banana leaves for steaming. What puts this place apart is the amount of shrimp on it.  I had two portions of the pic at 80k. Can I get cheaper? yes. Can I find the same amount of shrimp and this taste? Not yet! James — Google review We shared a tray of 20 bánh bèo for 80k. The price feels high compared to other places we have eaten and considering other reviews. Our mistake for not asking the price upfront. The food was very tasty, not greasy and lots of flavour. They could have filled the plates a little more for the price; for two people it would only make a light snack. Vy N — Google review Just a short walk right outside the imperial city. Really good banh beo. Khan T — Google review Delicious and plentiful! Clare H — Google review Good Dung2812 M — Google review (Translated by Google) The popular Banh Beo restaurant is not very crowded but the food is quite delicious.
Plus point: the owner offered a very large pot of cold tea even though I went with 2 people. The topping is quite a lot of ground shrimp and onions, the fried pork skin is delicious and crispy, and the dipping sauce is delicious and rich. Sit on the sidewalk near the river so the price is cool.
Minus point: 1 cup of cake is too small and empty, you can fill it up a little with the dough to make it feel fuller when eating. Compared to the price of 50k/tray including 20 cups of cake + 1 cup of pork skin, this is expensive. If 2 people eat 1 tray, it is not enough to be full, but if they eat 2 trays, they will be bored.

Quán Bánh bèo bình dân cũng không đông khách lắm nhưng ăn khá ngon.
Điểm cộng: chủ quán mời 1 bình trà lạnh rất to dù mình đi có 2 người. Topping tôm xay và hành khá nhiều, da heo chiên giòn ngon, nước chấm ngon đậm đà. Ngồi vỉa hè gần sông nên giá mát.
Điểm trừ: 1 chén bánh quá nhỏ và vơi, có thể đổ bột đầy lên 1 chút thì khi ăn sẽ có cảm giác đầy đặn hơn. So với giá tiền 50k/khay gồm 20 chén bánh + 1 chén da heo thì như vậy là đắt ạ. 2 người ăn 1 khay thì không đủ no nhưng nếu ăn 2 khay thì lại bị chán. Tieungoc H — Google review (Translated by Google) - The restaurant is popular, only has outdoor seating, low tables and chairs, and a small number of seats.
- Banh beo, a tray of 20 small cups (Hue banh beo), 1 cup of crispy, 1 cup of sweet fish sauce, banh beo is delicious but not hot.
- The price for a tray is 50k (maybe I'm a tourist so I got ripped off), the price is very high compared to a bowl of Hue banh beo as well as compared to the restaurant's popular space.

- Bánh bèo một khay 20 chén nhỏ (bánh bèo Huế), 1 chén giòn giòn, 1 chén nước mắm ngọt, bánh bèo ăn cũng ngon nhưng không nóng.
- Giá một khay là 50k (có thể mình là khách du lịch nên bị chém), giá vậy là rất cao so với một chén bánh bèo Huế cũng như so với không gian bình dân của quán.

The restaurant also offers a variety of other dishes such as seafood and beef noodles, lemongrass chicken skewers, and seafood soup. Visitors can opt for the combo to sample different Banh dishes at an affordable price. The local setting and friendly staff add to the overall dining experience. We visited quite late in the evening - away from the main strip ( which is horrid and full of badly dressed Europeans) and had the restaurant to ourselves save for a young Vietnamese family who joined as we were leaving. Excellent local dumplings and dipping sauce. The lemongrass pork kebabs were also excellent. Super meal. Jason L — Google review Great spots for all your Banhs. It is recommended to order all of them as a spread for your meal. Comes with plenty of food which gives you a taste of everything.

I am most impressed with the sauces. There is a unique sauce for each dish.

My favorite was the Banh Loc and Banh Nem. The Banh Nem was out of this world delicious!!

The hours aren’t accurate, but I showed up at 8am and the ownder had everything ready to serve. J H — Google review Start of food tour!! Definitely sets a high bar to follow!! Big variety of delicious, local & traditional Hue banh dishes. Steve T — Google review Good Hue delicatessen closed to main hub of coffee and restaurant. Walking distance to homestay Alley 7.
Quite standard eatery place and clean in Hue.
If you are hungry just want grab quick bite, then this is the place valued for money too. Thi N — Google review We had most things on the specials menu unique to Hue.
Taste was quite good and food fresh.
A little more costlier then most but my Vietnamese partner explained they use a lot of products to create flavour.
Worth the visit. Gjcc73 — Google review They serve Hue's famous rice cakes. This place is on the lonely planet's list but it failed to impress us. The food is just average but cheap, you get what you pay for Alberto R — Google review Great food, good service.
The menu walks you through what each of the dishes were.
The banh nam were amazing. Andrew E — Google review Food was very good, especially the Bánh Bèo and the Nem Lụi. The only downside could have been the price, as it’s more expensive than the average.

It's best enjoyed hot and served with sweet and sour flavors, fresh herbs, pickled vegetables, and cucumber. The cake offers a delightful blend of textures and flavors - chewy yet crunchy with rich fillings complemented by refreshing herbs. Really nice place, fun to try different things and the people who work here are friendly and kind (we came back a second time after a food tour and they remembered us 😂). The pancakes were fresh and the salad fillings were good and self service. Also really liked the quail egg dish, very tasty and of course kumkwat tea. Good value for money and a nice experience. Pauline D — Google review I've been a loyal customer of this snack shop since my student days. Famous for its "Bánh ép" with various toppings, the shop offers a unique experience where you can mix your own dipping sauce and pick fresh herbs to complement the dish. The thinly pressed tapioca pancake, grilled to perfection, is irresistibly chewy and flavorful.

One of my all-time favorite dishes here is "Bánh tráng trứng nướng" – crispy grilled rice paper with egg, pâté, mayonnaise, and chili sauce, creating a delightful balance of savory, creamy, and spicy flavors. Another must-try is "Trứng cút nướng phô mai" – grilled quail eggs with melted cheese, rich and indulgent.

The shop's atmosphere is spacious and airy, with an open kitchen where you can watch the entire cooking process, adding to the charm. The service is quick, and the staff is friendly, making the dining experience even better. Prices are reasonable, and the variety of dishes ensures there’s something for everyone.

Due to my busy schedule (and the fear of gaining weight!), I can only visit every few months, but every time I do, it’s worth it. If you ever travel to Huế, don't miss out on this place. Definitely take home some crispy dried "Bánh ép" as a souvenir—especially the beef and shrimp ones! Tran P — Google review Came here because someone in our group wanted to try all the trendy popular foods in Hue. I, myself, don’t care for food trends because they are often disappointing. This place was one of them. It was not busy at the time we went but I feel like the banh ep was nothing amazing- it was a cross between a Vietnamese crepe and a Korean pancake that was not as crispy or crunchy as I thought it would be. Our group also ordered the nem nướng (grilled pork skewers), and nghiêu hấp sả (lemongrass steamed clams).

Cheap eat? Sure- but I feel as though there are other better-tasting cheap options around. Rosanna T — Google review Great local snack place with a big menu. The food was good with reasonable prices. They also have sauce and herbs service stations that you can serve yourself. Ph D — Google review Bánh ép is a delicious street food from Hue, Vietnam, known for its unique flavor and presentation. It's a type of rice cake that is typically grilled with ingredients like shrimp, pork, or vegetables. The cakes are often served with various dipping sauces and fresh herbs, making it a delightful culinary experience.

When trying bánh ép for the first time, you can expect a delightful mix of textures and flavors. The crispy exterior contrasts beautifully with the soft filling, and the fresh herbs add a refreshing burst. It's best enjoyed in a bustling street market where you can soak in the local atmosphere.

Enjoy your culinary adventure in Hue at Banh Ep Gia Di! Helen L — Google review Went to try and I have to say it was really great! I tried 3 different Banh Ep's and all of them were delicious. The best one I'd say was the Banh Ep - Bo Kho (a.k.a the dried beef).
At first I was confused how to order and there is a paper on each table where you mark what you want and then hand it out to the waiter/waitress. Afterwards you pay at the counter. Rinkato — Google review I love the varieties of all the food here. You have so many choices when it comes to what kind of Hue snacks you would like to try out. I tried them all and realized they were not as mind blowing as the look suggested to my eyes, but that may be due to personal preferences. Still I'd recommend to come by and check it out.

This dish is a cornerstone of Hue's culinary influence across the country. Despite its fiery appearance, this noodle soup is relatively mild in terms of spiciness, although you can customize the heat level with garlic chili sauce. The rich broth is filled with an assortment of meats including sausages, meatballs, beef brisket, congealed pigs blood and a whole pigs foot. I really enjoyed the local specialty Bún bò Huế here.  What really stood out is the amazing depth of flavour in the broth that made it delicious.  Add on the noodles and your choice of topping combination from the menu and this was one of the best Bún bò Huế I've ever had.   Note that the noodles are not spicy at all - if you're used to it being spicy you'll need to add the chilli at the table yourself. Adrian M — Google review this is a tourist-friendly eatery with a spacious atmosphere, and it gets quite crowded during the holidays. the soup is light and refreshing, but the seasoning didn’t really suit my taste. personally, i find the bún bò huế at some smaller, more local eateries to be tastier and more affordable. still, it’s a nice touch that they also offer desserts like coconut jelly and bánh ít.

If you're visiting Huế, Vietnam, and looking for an authentic bowl of **Bún Bò Huế**, the famous beef noodle soup, you absolutely must stop by the small shop at **19 Lý Thường Kiệt**. This place serves one of the most flavorful and satisfying bowls of Bún Bò Huế I’ve ever had.

**The Taste**
Right from the first spoonful of the broth, I was blown away. The soup is rich, aromatic, and perfectly balanced, with layers of flavor that highlight the traditional spices and herbs of Huế. The lemongrass aroma is prominent but not overpowering, blending beautifully with the subtle heat of chili oil. There’s a savory depth to the broth that feels like it’s been simmered for hours, capturing the essence of Vietnamese cuisine.

The noodles are perfectly cooked—slippery, slightly chewy, and ideal for soaking up the delicious broth. The beef slices are tender and juicy, while the addition of pork hock, congealed blood (if you're adventurous), and other toppings make the dish even more exciting. The star of the bowl is the balance: no single flavor dominates, but every bite feels like a celebration.
**Fresh Ingredients**
The freshness of the ingredients is another standout feature. Accompanying the noodles is a plate of fresh herbs like mint, basil, and shredded banana blossoms, along with lime wedges and chili paste. These garnishes allow you to customize the bowl to suit your taste, whether you prefer it tangier, spicier, or with a hint of herbal freshness.

#### **Service and Atmosphere**
This shop at 19 Lý Thường Kiệt is unassuming—simple plastic tables and stools, as is typical for many local eateries in Vietnam. But what it lacks in decor, it more than makes up for in flavor and charm. The staff are kind, quick, and clearly take pride in their food. You’ll feel like you’re experiencing a slice of Huế’s culinary culture, far from the touristy spots. It’s a genuine, no-frills experience.

#### **The Verdict**
I honestly can’t recommend this place enough. I’ve had Bún Bò Huế in many places, but this one felt like a revelation. It’s not just food—it’s a cultural experience. The combination of the rich broth, fresh herbs, and hearty proteins makes it a standout, and I would happily return any time I’m in Huế. If you’re a fan of Vietnamese cuisine or just looking to try something truly special, this is the spot.

**Pro Tip:**
Get there early, as the place can fill up quickly, and they might run out of soup by the afternoon. Also, don’t forget to pair your Bún Bò Huế with a refreshing iced tea, a local soda to round out the meal or coconut jelly. Hannah O — Google review I was planning to try the noodles here, but before I even stepped inside, I was met with an unbelievably rude attitude. As I was parking in front of the shop, a woman stormed out and rudely demanded that if I wanted to park there, I had to dine in—despite the fact that the parking spot isn’t even theirs to control.

I have no idea if the noodles are good or not, and frankly, I don't care anymore. With staff this unwelcoming and unpleasant, I wouldn't set foot in this place even if the food was free. Steve L — Google review The most bland bun bo Hue I’ve ever tasted in my life!!! Meat was chewy and the broth had no flavor. No one in my big group liked it. The bathroom was filthy dirty.

Bun bo hue 9 Cơm Hến 17 Save 4.1 ( 648 ) • Mentioned on 2 lists $ $$$ cheap Bistro Restaurant Cơm Hến 17 is a popular dish in Hue, Vietnam, known for its vibrant mix of flavors and textures. It features cooked rice topped with baby basket clams stir-fried with garlic, onion, fish sauce, pepper, and mint leaves. The dish also includes crispy pork skins, roasted peanuts, shrimp paste, and fresh greens. Some variations may include rice noodles instead of rice and additional ingredients like julienned green apples and glass noodles. We tried the com hen and bun hen here. Both were very good. Just add the light broth to your liking and mix it together. The mussels, mushroom and peanuts give this dish earthy tones, the pork scratchings give a satisfying little crunch and it’s very moreish. A light meal and very cheap so you could perhaps try a few things on the menu.
It’s very popular with locals and has that local vibe with little chairs and small metal tables. There are lots of places for Com Hen on this street along the river. Definitely try this while in Hue! Manpuku W — Google review Very busy place mostly because it's cheap and has a lot of seating. Parking directly in front is limited for the amount of people there. You can park motorbikes on the opposite side of the road as well.

It's very noisy there and the shouts to call the food orders. They service fairly quickly.

I ordered Cơm Hến (miniature mussels) which are only found around this region. I didn't even see them in the bowl since they're small to begin with and even smaller when cooked. The other items were sides. Most of the food in Hue is typically bland to begin with. Culturally this region eats bland.

The food isn't bad and it's not spectacular. It's good cheap food. I would give this place 3.5 stars mostly for good service. Thai T — Google review A Huế local specialty that you must try. We were recommended to try this place by our Grab driver. The service was very nice. The lady recommended to us what to order and she showed us how to eat it. The dishes bursted with a lot of flavour. The atmosphere was alright but the cutlery and the tables needed a bit of a clean. Jane D — Google review Com Hen (boiled clam with rice) eatery, with clam rice noodles, clam porridge and lots of local desserts. Clam porridge is really tasty, can taste the sweetness of the clams. Ram It rice cake and banh nam (rice cake with pork and shrimp) is also good. The place is along the river and very rustic and simple. Resident dogs are sweet too. Ended up coming twice. Sarah S — Google review Very popular place, with dishes I had still never tried in Vietnam. A bit messy and noisy but definitey I would go back! It has savory dishes and sweet drinks. Laia N — Google review Place is as rustic and local as it gets with their resident dogs wandering around as we ate which is nice in my opinion.
Food is nice and tasty and we were there twice in the short 2 days while we were in Hue.
The durian dessert was really nice as were the clam rice, noodles and porridge. Simon S — Google review Came here for the com hen - which was what Hue is known for. I found this place based purely off google. But the mi hen was better than the rice imo! And wow the nem lui was amazing! It was super flavourful and the dipping sauce complimented it extremely well!

Definitely if you come here, try the nem lui too. It surpassed other nem lui speciality spots I’ve been to! Jay V — Google review A traditional staple of the region - cơm hến (clam rice).

Customers can expect a delicious bowl of bun bo Hue with savory broth and all the traditional fixings. Great intro to the famous local Bun Bo Hue. Lots of ingredients in the big bowl (60k VND) including the pork ribs, crab ball, pork ball, Blood cake in a savoury broth. Most customers are Vietnamese, thus confirmation of its authentic taste. Adding a little of chili paste will make it more spicy & sweat inducing sensation. Their yogurt is a tasty treat to counter the burning sensation in the mouth. Give it a try. 😁 Robert G — Google review Want to try something authentic? This is a place you want to enjoy a Bun Bo Hue and that is the only dish they serve. Have it with some nice cold beer and it’s a perfect match. If you’re local in the area, give this a try. King A — Google review Delicious pork noodle with pork, pork and beef ball. Quite clean and operate by a man. 60k per bowl. Kellie K — Google review Not good at all. Minimal shrimp oil, no pig trotters and blood was old and dark on inside as you can see from photos Charles P — Google review Absolutely go here! We stumbled across it and that have a big pot on with bundles of lemongrass, spices and meatballs inside. We got the big one and it was amazing, very tender slow cooked  pork and a great big bowl of greens without skimping on the good stuff - lots of coriander, some kind of cirled vegetable, sprouts, etc. Fantastic meal! Sian O — Google review One of the famous spots where you can get a nice bowl of soup noodle. Not sure why but a lot of taxis will bring you here to try out. The service is good and you can get a big bowl of noodles with a decent pricing. The vegetables are quite a lot and is free of charge. Troy — Google review Definitely have to try for authentic Bun bo hue. Service is great, the server spoke English perfectly, total shock. Cash only service. Waquefa B — Google review Bun Bo here is super great!
It is authentic noodles which everyone should try.
Broth: sweet naturally, not too salty but very suited my taste.
Hygience: good
Service: friendly and helfully
Location: very good place to look for. (at the left corner of Century Hotel)
Highly recommend.
Well deserved of 5 stars.
Please note that the price is same for foreigners and local residents, around 30k-60k/bowl depended on size and toppings. I am not related to owner but I felt disappointed at some reviews which were not practical...they complained for price 50k/bowl. I can not understand why they commented like that.
I hope some people should well survey or research before blaming others...

Didn't eat at the restaurant as menu not as authentic as it could be. Fun driving to and from the city on a motorbike.  Very good shuttle service if required. Rachelle H — Google review Very disappointing experience at the reception. I reserved the room before but when I arrived they said the room I booked was sold out and they only have the higher rate available. To deal with the situation professionally, they should let us take the other room with the same rate but in this case, they just constantly repeat the room is not avaible and we only have the other room left. And finally the other room did not have the required bed types that suit my family. We ended up finding another accommodation in the very last minutes. We have our weekend spoiled and will not recommend this until they have a better reception. Tinh H — Google review This is nice place for who love the nature.

With 99 rooms and bungalows, including Traditional Vietnamese Pool Houses and Honeymoon Bungalows, guests can enjoy air-conditioned accommodations with private balconies, satellite TV, and free Wi-Fi. WE loved this resort.  It was so lovely and the grounds were serene.  Service was great and food was excellent.  We wished we would have stayed here longer.  The only thing we found odd was the bar in the evening.  It was indoor, and echo like so voices carried and it lacked atmosphere.  Would recommend developing an outdoor space for an evening drink.  The pools were amazing and the sauna / jacuzzi which is included with spa is lovely. Chad H — Google review Lovely garden setting 15-20min outside of Hue (depends on traffic). They run a free shuttle 6x/day, but must be booked at least 30min in advance. My “superior” room (371) was great. Spacious, well appointed & well illuminated.

The downside was the food. The breakfast buffet was fine, good selection & well prepared. But the included dinner was marginal at best. Fortunately, there are 2 local restaurants across the street providing tastier food at much better value. Joe H — Google review We had a great stay at Pilgrimage.
Our room was spacious, clean, and well equipped — and we were upgraded to a quieter section of the resort where a few rooms share a semi-private pool. It’s an adults-only area (no kids allowed), which made it even more peaceful.

The overall atmosphere of the resort was exactly what we were looking for: laid-back, authentic, relaxing- surrounded by beautiful gardens.
One of the highlights was the spa. Every guest receives a complimentary 30-minute spa treatment, which was a really nice gesture and part of their daily routine. We often upgraded it to longer massages (60 or 90 minutes), but having that 30-minute base every day felt special and thoughtful.

The food was also a strong point.
They offer both à la carte and buffet options, with a mix of local Vietnamese dishes and international choices. We mostly ordered Vietnamese seafood, especially shrimp dishes, and were very happy with the quality and flavors. Breakfast was great too — fresh fruits, eggs cooked to order, and a good selection without feeling overwhelming.

Service across the board was very good. Staff were friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Transfers (like taxi bookings for sightseeing) were always well organized and punctual.
There’s honestly not much to criticize. Madam M — Google review This property is vast and beautiful. The weather didn’t cooperate while we were there but we still enjoyed our stay immensely. The staff are top notch. All employees, regardless of role, greeted us warmly. Everyone was warm and welcoming. The location is a little out of the way but we enjoyed the meals at the restaurant and the happy hour in the bar so the location wasn’t an issue for us. A shout out to Claudia and Cristy for their friendliness and help. Jennifer P — Google review Beautiful luxury hotel with an amazing swimming pool. All the staff were super friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. Special thanks to Claudia for her kindness and warm welcome. We’ve been traveling around Vietnam for two weeks, and this has been the best hotel experience we’ve had since we arrived. We totally recommend this hotel!

The breakfast and the dinner were very well and fresh prepared, they absolutely delicious.
We need to mention that the staff (especially Thanh and Cristy) made our stay unforgettable and extremely pleasant. They were so professional and kind and took a great care of us, we felt at home from the first moment we went in.
We highly recommend this hotel and we’ll definitely book it again if we come back to Hué. Ian C — Google review Amazing hotel with amazing staff.

Starts off as a six star ! Best breakfast in Vietnam by far. Superb staff. We had dinner included and that was v good too. We had a lovely bungalow by the adult only pool which was very pleasant and spacious. One star deducted for intermittent WiFi and rather expensive drinks compared to other hotels. Our favourite hotel in Vietnam so far. Beautiful grounds. Yes it is slightly out of town but they have a free shuttle and a Grab only costs d100k ($4) - the Grab taxis literally wait for a booking in the car park out front (it’s so easy).

The ecolodge follows environmentally and community-responsible practices, providing accommodations close to nature. Guests can choose from standard rooms or bungalows, all surrounded by lush gardens and natural sunlight. With 15 years of experience in hospitality, the lodge features 30 rooms constructed from bamboo, wood, thatch, and straw. Hue Ecolodge

Of the hotels I stayed at during my trip to Vietnam in 2024, Hue Ecolodge was by far my favorite. It is situated along the Perfume River and there is charm to it that the other cookie cutter hotels lacked.

Hue Ecolodge’s design reflects the regions heritage, dark hard wood furniture and doors. The gardens are lush with vegetation, with locally grown tropical fruits (Vietnamese fig, bananas, jackfruit, just to name a few and a plethora of beautiful flowers). Vegetables and fruits grown in the garden are utilized in the dining options of deliciously prepared salads and other dishes regionally known o Hue.

The welcome flowers in each room are plucked from within the hotel’s grounds, managed by a husband and wife gardening duo. They keep the plants thriving, maintaining, and continuing to find ways to improve the grounds. All of the staff are all so sweet, helpful, and attentive.

The one small downside to being at Hue Ecolodge is its location. Being in the outskirts of town, the walking score is low. The only way to get to the city center is to order a taxi with assistance from the front desk. But this is a minor downside as you can borrow a bicycle from the hotel and leisurely ride bike around.

Overall, if you like nature, a serene and quiet hotel, Hue Ecolodge delivers. Le N — Google review Very clean, well managed and comfortable place. With attention to details, the customer feels cuddled by the staff. Tasty food and good drinks, well equipped breakfast and amazing rooms with a lot of services (towels, Vietnamese hats, umbrellas, bathrobe, flip flops, …).
Amazing pool, clean and warm, perfect for the happy hours during the afternoon and for a nice swim before bed.
Reliable and stable WiFi, attention to environment and sustainability is a plus of this stay. When you come here, you have everything you need for your comfortable relax time! Definitely recommended and well worth a stop if you are in Huê! Tatiana F — Google review Our stay at Hue ecolodge was more than just a recreation. We totally enjoyed it all: the territory, our room, the breakfast and overall atmosphere. The hotel is located in a quiet area, here you can feel you’re a part of nature. Everything is super green, clean and well maintained. There’s a huge orchard and bushes with beautiful flowers, the whole area is so peaceful and tranquil, I loved just to have a walk there early in the morning and see how nature is waking up. The stuff is always smiling and ready to help. You can take a bike there and explore the territory outside the hotel. Don’t hesitate on it, just do it. Can’t pass by the breakfast, we were totally taken away by crepes with homemade jam, cheese and famous Hue soup, it was fantastic. Also, the view from the restaurant is so rewarding, it made our mornings there even more pleasant. The rooms didn’t disappoint either: clean, spacious with great WiFi and what I liked the best was outside shower and wooden bath, unforgettable feelings. Totally recommend this hotel, you won’t regret if you stay there. Lina M — Google review The rooms were more humid than outside.
Lots of spiders and gekko / frogs got into the room all the time. Almost no hot water. Mold on pillows.

In the buffet the staff let the cats jump up and eat some of the food.

The pool was closed and there was a lot of noice from renovation.

Not the best experience. Nick U — Google review We booked this hotel for one night during our trip to Hoi An and Hue. It was lovely, with nature alla round. We also tried the restaurant there for dinner and the food was really great, worth a try, because It had  lot of different traditional plates.
The only thing that was off is that we have read online that it was available a shuttle service form the hotel to the city centre, but at the reception they told us It was not in use.
Rooms were very spacious with gorgeous patio and open shower..
After dinner, a cute idea that I loved was that we found on our door a small piece of paper with a good night tale, about a Vietnamese legend. It was very sweet. Maria F — Google review Had lunch at this quiet out of the way ecolodge which consisted of some prepared courses and some courses that were cooked ourselves (with training of course).

Che Hem on Hung Vuong Street is highly recommended for this delightful dessert. The generous portions of Chè Cầm are priced at around VND 3,000. After my family and I enjoyed walking around downtown Hue historical city, we decided to go eat Vietnamese Che for dessert. So we walked across the river and there we found Che's Cam.

I would highly recommend this place to all Vietnamese who would like to eat Che. Victoria N — Google review The sweet soups at this shop are all VND 15.000, but they fail to appeal to my palate. The Bột Lọc Heo Quay is average, with the roasted pork lacking its signature salty aroma and ginger notes. The Chè Trái Cây is just a few simple fruits, haphazardly cut and not very pretty, including papaya and avocado, two fruits that I personally find unsuitable for Chè Trái Cây because their flavour and aroma easily overwhelm the flavour of the other fruits. Genevieve V — Google review Wow! Remarkable Vietnamese, dessert. I never quite had anything like some of the ingredients. Be sure and try several different kinds of pork meet which you can mix in.

Absolute bargain and a delicious meal. Great relaxed setting, surrounded by friendly locals. Got a real feel for Vietnam. Definitley head down to this place.

The menu features fresh and aromatic vegetarian dishes made from locally-sourced natural ingredients, with options for customization such as adding tofu. Guests can enjoy the tranquil garden setting while being entertained by friendly dogs. The garden cafe has great vegan options! The location is super nice and quiet and the staff is very friendly. Our highlight was their homemade soy sauce with garlic, vinegar and sugar. Our favorite dishes: Roasted Eggplant, rice noodle with spring rolls and the rice with tomato sauce tofu. BBT — Google review Really handy cafe for a very affordable dinner. Good value for the food you get. I tried the tofu with tomatoe sauce and rice, and it was quite nice. For a low-budget traveller is the perfect place. Lurdes V — Google review What a great space!
You can enjoy some good vegetarian dishes in a nice garden area.
Actually we went there twice while being in Hue.
Defenitely recommend! Julius H — Google review If you go for anything, I highly recommend the Vegan Unagi Don (braised eggplant with steamed white rice and cucumber salad). It’s an excellent dish, very flavorful.

We also tried the Vietnamese noodles with fried tofu and soya sauce, it was good but not as flavorful as the eggplant dish.

The Banana Pancake with Chocolate Sauce was disappointing. It’s was hard/dense in texture, not very sweet and not flavorful.

The Lemon Juice with salted plum was refreshing.

Excellent service in a lovely setting. I’d definitely return for the eggplant, but skip the pancake. Bob — Google review Delicious food here! Definitely recommend. Staff were friendly and helpful. Very cute dogs. Thank you for the good experience. Jasmine R — Google review We had lunch a the garden cafe and it was really nice. We ate the rice with tofu and salad and it was lovely.
Price was good!
The staff was lovely and the atmosphere too!
Recommend it for a nice lunch. Giorgia B — Google review Pretty disappointed - not recommend to chose the curry and the fried vegetables with tofu. Bad quality and little portion and not tasty. Only ginger tea we liked - apart from this people were overwhelmed with serving and seemed stressed.

The dish consists of vermicelli placed on a basket over hot embers, with an array of spices available for diners to customize their meal. This small family restaurant offers the dish at affordable prices, starting from 20k. Diners can expect the turmeric vermicelli to be flavorful and well-prepared. (Translated by Google) The shop has moved to 154 Ba Trieu, in the alley! You haven't updated on Google yet.

The noodles are delicious, fragrant with turmeric and have a light fatty taste. A little salty but not too much, in my opinion it would be just right if there was more lemon. Small, cozy space in front of the house.

A strange dish you can try when visiting Hue, support us :)

Eating intestines that are not clean is a bit disgusting. It's not excellent, but it's easier to eat than I thought, even though I don't often eat turmeric. I've been from the North and the South for a long time, so I'm familiar with the tastes of both North and South.

Nghe nói giá ở đây nhỉnh hơn so với các chợ nhưng mình thấy quán sạch sẽ, lòng cũng làm rất sạch, ăn lòng mà ko sạch thì hơi bị ghê í.

This eatery is renowned for its crispy and smaller version of bánh xèo, known as bánh khoa. The experience is enhanced by their flavorful dipping sauce that pleasantly surprises your palate. It was my first time eating bánh khoái which is a smaller and crispier version of bánh xèo.
It was really tasty, and I have to say that the sauce was so good (I did not expect to like it that much!)!
At first there was no table available, so the lady told me to sit at the table behind her but there were many used plates. When I told her that I would be leaving, she insisted that I stayed and asked a waitress to clean it for me immediately. I could feel she had a great sense of hospitality and that she wanted to make her customers try her food !
Although she was very busy cooking, she explained to me how to eat it and prepare it step by step.
The bánh khoái was so tasty and the service was very nice ! I would definitely come back ! Alix T — Google review (Translated by Google) Hue banh hoi shop is a great destination for those who want to enjoy traditional banh hoi in the ancient city of Hue. I had the opportunity to visit this restaurant and I was really impressed.

First of all, I want to tell about the location of Hue banh hoi shop on Google Map. Finding and locating the restaurant is very easy, just enter the restaurant name and Google Map will display the address as well as detailed instructions on how to get to the restaurant. This helps me save time and get to my destination quickly without having to worry about getting lost.

Coming to Hue cake shop, I was welcomed by a clean and airy space. The service staff was very enthusiastic and friendly, helping me feel very comfortable. As for banh hoi, they are really delicious, with a crispy crust and delicious filling inside, blending the sweet and fatty taste of shrimp and meat. I also enjoyed the delicious fish sauce that came with the cake.

Through my experience at Hue banh canh shop, I will definitely come back again. I will also recommend this restaurant to my friends and relatives. I am very satisfied with the service and quality at Banh Khoai Hue restaurant and will not hesitate to leave a positive review on Google Map.

Việc tìm kiếm và định vị quán rất dễ dàng, chỉ cần nhập tên quán và Google Map sẽ hiển thị địa chỉ cũng như hướng dẫn cách đến quán một cách chi tiết. Điều này giúp tôi tiết kiệm thời gian và nhanh chóng đến nơi mà không phải lo lắng về việc lạc đường.

Đến với quán bánh khoái Huế, tôi được chào đón bởi không gian sạch sẽ và thoáng đãng. Nhân viên phục vụ rất nhiệt tình và thân thiện, giúp tôi cảm thấy rất thoải mái. Còn với bánh khoái, chúng thực sự ngon, với lớp vỏ giòn tan và nhân bên trong thơm ngon, hòa quyện vị ngọt béo của tôm và thịt. Tôi cũng được thưởng thức nước mắm chấm rất ngon đi kèm bánh.

Qua trải nghiệm tại quán bánh khoái Huế, tôi chắc chắn sẽ quay lại lần nữa. Tôi cũng sẽ recommend quán này cho bạn bè và người thân của mình. Tôi rất hài lòng với dịch vụ và chất lượng tại quán bánh khoái Huế và sẽ không ngần ngại để đánh giá tích cực trên Google Map.

I went on a Saturday night but it was quite empty. The food was served quickly. If you could sit at a table outside, the space would be airy, but the restaurant's layout is not very reasonable, so there should be more small tables.
I think the price is reasonable for tourists, 55k boiled meat rolls, 60k roasted pork rolls

Đồ ăn ổn, mắm chấm quán sẽ để riêng mắm ớt cho mình tự pha, vì mình k ăn được cay nên điểm này thấy hợp lí.
