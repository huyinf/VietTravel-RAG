[LI] Thua Thien Hue Food Guide: What & Where to eat in Hue
[P] Needless to say, Huế’s cuisine is among the finest in the country. Believe me, it will blow your mind and then sometimes you will sit and wonder like me: “How come a small city like Hue can have so many kinds of food like this?” Just sitting around and thinking of what you will eat could take the whole day!
[P] Contents
[H4] Specialties
[P] Coming to Huế, specialties are definitely something that you cannot skip out on your way to explore the attempting cuisine of a new land.
[P] Beef Noodle (Bún Bò)Beef Noodle, one of the most genuine and typical specialties of Huế, is so widely known that we, both the gastronome and the glutton, would like to call it sincerely with the local name “Bún bò Huế” (Huế Beef Noodle) to refer to the region where it originally comes from. Not as simple as it looks, behind each delicious bowl of beef noodle is hidden the secret recipe through the hands of the tremendously talented cooks who make the dish with their passion and love for traditional cuisine. The ingredients, of course, cannot miss the scrumptious cow’s muscles with hard-boiled pig’s feet and the typical light red consommé adding up to the dish’s attractiveness and temptation. Although the dish itself has already been quite completed, it is easy to be mixed with other ingredients and entremets such as fennel spicing up the smell, shrimp paste strengthening the flavour and chilli powder for “an explosion” of taste and deliciousness. Beef Noodle can be eaten mostly as breakfast, lunch and is especially suitable as “a stomach-warmer” in the winter during cold days. For its long existence and being in favour of many people, hundreds of restaurants have been born to fulfill the love for beef noodle of their customers. However, these few are the most popular for their distinctive charisma and the most delicious Huế Beef Noodle.

[P] Mussel Rice (Cơm Hến)Another dish that I am sure you would love to try is Mussel Rice (Cơm Hến), the most familiar and delectable dish in the varied menu of Huế’s cuisine. Mussel Rice is also a simple yet appetizing dish of Vietnam’s middle area that is adored by almost everyone and favorably selected as one of their daily main courses. The main ingredient is of course mussels! If not, the dish would not even be named mussel rice. However, not stopping at one ingredient, the cooks still ambitiously want to complete the dish by other kinds of spices and entremets with the most important criteria: cheap but delicious and nutritious. Therefore, roasted groundnut and pig’s skin have been added to stimulate the cereal and meat-sweet smell and flavour as well as creating the perfect combination between the sweet, softness of rice and the crispy, nutty flavour of groundnut and roasted pig’s skin. In addition, the dish is also quite easy to be mixed with other kinds of vegetable such as sour starfruit, Indian taro, dried scallion and banana flower. Believe it or not, you will never forget its unique flavour once you have tried it.
[P] The best address to try a genuine bowl of mussel rice is probably in Mussel Hillock Village (Làng Cồn Hến) though there are many other places that also offer very delicious dishes.Cồn Hến Mussel RiceAddress: Cồn Hến Village, Hương Lưu Commune, Vỹ Dạ Ward, Huế City, Thừa Thiên Huế Province

[P] Rice Spaghetti Soup (Bánh Canh)This may be one of the new dishes that you would love to try right after arriving at Huế. At the first glance, you may get the impression that there is absolutely nothing different about this dish compared to others: still rice noodle, some meat, some vegetable and regular consommé. However, hold on until you actually taste it because it can easily turn you into a “rice spaghetti lover” at the very first bite. What I love about rice spaghetti is that the dish actually brings you a lot of feelings and sensation for food. It is truly the art of the cooks to create such delicious and yummy bowl of rice spaghetti soup from the cheapest and most common ingredients that you can easily get from any market. Rice spaghetti soup can be made from different kinds of rice depending on the choice of the eaters and there are also many famous kinds of rice spaghetti all around Huế City. However, these few have become some sort of “legend” with the longest time of making the dish as well as the most delicious and distinctive rice spaghetti soup.
[P] Nam Phổ Rice Spaghetti (Bánh Canh Nam Phổ), originated from Nam Phổ Village, has soon become the most famous kind in the country for its unique and absolutely irresistible flavour. Since the time when we were still small kids, Nam Phổ Rice Spaghetti has been the favourite dish of a lot of people in Huế City. Back then, because our parents were still living in poverty, no restaurant could they build to sell rice spaghetti. Therefore, young sisters, mothers and even very old grandmas living in Nam Phổ decided to carry their bamboo frames and went all around the city to sell rice spaghetti. When there was no food and people had to live in shortage, a bowl of rice spaghetti, though cheap, was enough to warm up someone’s heart.
[P] Snakehead Fish Rice Spaghetti (Bánh Canh Cá Lóc): Although its name is quite creepy with the “snakehead” thing, the dish is totally in opposite: delicious, addictive and absolutely mouth-watering. In fact, Snakehead Fish Rice Spaghetti is one of the most favourable dishes of Huế’s people. What makes the dish more attractive than others is the simmered fish meat that is extremely juicy and savoury. The left fish consommé will keep being boiled with bones to make the finishing bouillon used for the dish. Quail eggs and pork pies can also be used along with the dish. Once you have started, believe me, you will not want to stop.
[P] Mrs. Đợi Rice Spaghetti is also a long-time dish, about 30 years old as I recall. The name of the dish was taken after the name of Mrs. Đợi, who makes it. The fact that Mrs. Đợi Rice Spaghetti Soup can be so popular despite being cheap and simply made in a small food stall is because of its distinctive appearance and making process. What you will get at first is just a bowl of rice spaghetti with some kind of opaque consommé, a few shrimps, meat balls and some spices. However, what interests me is how you, not the cook, will make your own bowl of rice spaghetti with the spices and ingredients given. There will be quail eggs, scallion, spice, chilli oil and so on. Then you can mix the ingredients together and season your dish just the way you like. In the end, I am sure you will be surprised with what you have made and I believe it is always better when you can make your own dish, especially when it is totally something new.Thúy-Nam Phổ Rice SpaghettiAddress: #16 Phạm Hồng Thái Street, Huế City, Thừa Thiên HuếProvinceOpening hours: 3:00pm – 9:00pm

[P] Nhật Lệ Sticky Rice Cake (Bánh Chưng Nhật Lệ)Sticky Rice Cake has soon been a familiar food to anyone interested in Vietnamese cuisine. Although, for some people, Nhật Lệ Sticky Rice Cake still sounds quite new and unfamiliar, it has actually reached its own popularity to other countries and is in favour of people living far away from their beloved country Vietnam, especially in Lunar New Year. In Vietnam, it is quite rare that there is a person who has never once heard of Nhật Lệ Sticky Rice Cake.  The wonderful woman who has made Nhật Lệ Sticky Rice Cake for nearly all her life (she is now about 80 years old), the mother of Nhật Lệ is no one else but “white-haired mother” or also known as Mrs. Bê. Behind each delicious sticky rice cake delivered to the hands of the customers are the masterpiece of seasoning and the perfection as well as the carefulness in ingredient choosing. The rice must be rich and sticky and pork must be juicy; how much rice, how much meat or even how many leaves used for wrapping are restrictively checked. This is why Nhật Lệ Sticky Rice Cake has been easily loved and adored by so many people for its absolutely delicious flavour and being appetizingly prepared.
[P] Address: #117 Nhật Lệ Street, Huế City, Thừa Thiên Huế ProvinceOpening hours: 8:00am – 9:00pm
[P] Nậm Lọc Steamed Savoury Rice Cake (Bánh Bèo Nậm Lọc)Nậm Lọc Steamed Savoury Rice Cake is probably the most interesting dish at the decline of day. Nậm Lọc is served in small plates that create an appetizingly elegant preparation and appearance. This is also a really great idea because you can actually eat more when eating little by little in small dishes. However, the purpose of the cook when preparing in small dishes is to let the customers slowly sense the sweet smell of bullion and the softness, stickiness of the steamed savoury rice cake. The dish is made of steamed rice powder with ground shrimp powder scattered on top and is eaten with sweet fish sauce. The flavour, just like its name, is savoury yet very balanced so that you can eat until you are fed up with it. I still remembered eating more than 10 small dishes of steamed savoury rice cake and I still wanted more! So take your chance when you come to Huế and eat as much as you can or else you will regret it.
[P] Mrs. Đỏ Nậm Lọc (very famous)Address: #8 Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm Street, Phú Cát Ward, Huế City, Thừa Thiên Huế ProvinceTel: (+84) 543 541 182Opening hours: 8:00am – 9:00pm

[P] Nậm Lọc (Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Street)Address: Street-side food stall on Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Night-street, Vĩnh Ninh Ward, Huế City, Thừa Thiên Huế Province
[P] Grilled-Meat Steamed Thin Rice Pancake (Bánh Ướt Thịt Nướng)If you have once tried Rolled Phở in Hanoi (Phở Cuốn Hà Nội) then you will be quite familiar to this dish. The steamed thin rice pancake is actually made of rice powder steamed into thin layers of phở then they are rolled up outside of grilled-meat to make the finishing dish. The difference is instead of using stir fired beef as the stuffing, the cooks have intentionally and cleverly used pork grilled on hot coal to stimulate the sweet-smelling as well as adding up to the juicy flavour of the pork. The stuffing though simple with grilled pork and salad but when being combined with the sweet fish sauce of vinegary turnip, carrot and a little bit the chilli, the flavour is absolutely and undeniably irresistible. Remember that I have already warned you. Therefore, be careful if you do not want to be a “grilled-meat steamed thin rice pancake worshipper”.
[P] Huyền Anh Grilled-Meat Rice CakeAddress: #207 Kim Long Street, Phú Thuận Ward, Huế City, Thừa Thiên Huế ProvinceTel: (+84) 543 833 260Opening hours: 9:00am – 9:00pm (sometimes closed at noon)
[P] Grilled-Meat Noodle (Bún Thịt Nướng)Mentioning of noodle, I can ensure that even if you are a foodaholic or not, Grilled-Meat Noodle will never let you down. Formed and born from the love for traditional cuisine, Grilled-Meat Noodle bears the soul and the taste of its own land-mother. From the making process to the seasoning, it is the elegance to the perfection: chopped lemongrass stimulating the taste, delicious roasted sesame rousing the sense of smell and sweet fish sauce savours the flavour. The special thing about the dish is the meat grilled on hot coal, lean and greasy that you can hardly deny the attempting calling of it. The sauce is also very carefully and advancedly made with goose liver, grinded nuts, fish sauce and pepper. This is such a wonderful combination of flavour that I bet you can only like but cannot hate.

[P] Mixed Girdle Cake and Omelet Girdle CakeGirdle Cake is one of the most favourite snacks of Huế’s teen. The simply crunchy cake’s layer is enough to make you feel excited. The ingredients are also very simple with steamed flour rolled into thin layers with omelet (for omelet girdle cake), pate, dried beef and meat covering on top. Mixed Gridle Cake is more like a kind of noodle with delicious dried beef, quail eggs and vegetable.

[P] Plain Rice Flan (Bánh Khoái)If you have once tried Bánh Tôm Hồ Tây then Plain Rice Flan, also known as Bánh Khoái, gives you the same impression. The flour is deep fired and stuffed with shrimps, meat and vegetable looking very attempting and mouth-watering. The appetizing yellow color of the crisp cover is just the special thing of the rice flan.

[P] Fried Rice Cake (Bánh Lọc Chiên)Honestly, I must say, Fried Rice Cake is one of the most interesting kinds of cakes that I have ever known. It is simply fried rice powder that you want to eat when getting bored but how amazing the cooking technique is that the cake is crispy on the outside but still soft and sticky on the inside.
[P] Thạch Hãn Fried Rice CakeAddress: #134 Thạch Hãn Street, Huế City, Thừa Thiên Huế ProvinceTel: (+84) 126 363 6545
[P] Asian Fried Sweet Sesame Donut (Bánh Tiêu), Pateso (Bánh Batiso), Dumpling (Bánh Bao), and Fried Banana Cake (Bánh Chuối)These kinds of cakes are generally Huế’s fried cakes that are loved by many people. Everyday, some cake stalls will wander around the city to wait for you to order one of their delicious cakes. Asian Fried Sweet Sesame is soft and saccharine; pateso is crispy with hundreds of fried cake layers; dumpling is either steamed or fried and banana cake is just that sweet and yummy.
[P] Green Pea CakeIf this is the first time you have heard of Huế’s Green Pea Cake then you should be prepared to try it now. It is also very widely known as the “Noble Cake” used in the Lunar New Year in Huế. Generally, Green Pea Cake is a very wonderful kind of cakes with a variety of shapes and sizes made similarly to the forms of fruits such as strawberry, mango, grape and so on. It is also very popular in Huế, especially to children for its eye-catching appearance.
[P] Grilled Corn and Steamed Cassava with Scraped Coconut (Bắp Nướng và Sắn Hấp Dừa)These are quite common foods of Huế that are absolutely enjoyed by all people from the well-to-do families to the normal ones. Eating corns and cassavas has somehow become a kind of custom of Vietnamese people since war time when there was no food and rice at all. Until now, they are still very in favour of most people, especially in winter as effective “cold cures”.
[P] Grilled Fermented Pork Roll (Nem Lụi)In my opinion, Nem Lụi is something that you absolutely cannot reject. It is so good, so delicious and addictive that every teenager can hardly say “no” when someone asks them out for some nem lụi. Eating nem lụi with a hot chilli sauce is the best thing you can ever experience. I think I will stick around to my nem lụi dish the whole day long and not even bother to leave!
[H4] Other delicious dishes
[P] Beside the delicious specialties, other dishes are some kinds of Huế’s unique features that draw the attention of the most picky gastronome with the most regular and common dishes.
[P] Saffron Noodle (Bún Nghệ)Although the ingredients are of certain simplicity and the dish is not quite of a high-class food, it is still extremely in favour of many cuisine lovers, especially young girls and women for its useful effect of health and skin-beautifying. The dish has this very eye-catching yellow color of noodle stir fried with saffron and chicken’s parts. Vegetable such as coriander is also used to add up to the flavour.

[P] Fish Sauce Noodle (Bún Mắm Nêm)Just hearing its name only is enough to make you hungry. Especially for some people, Fish Sauce Noodle is just like a childhood treat that they would love to enjoy with their friends after school. The first impression that you get with the noodle is distinctive. Indeed, this is a very special yet common dish that you would love to try once. Fish sauce noodle is a combination of pork pies, vegetable and of course, fish sauce-the ingredient that makes the name of the dish.

[P] Sticky Rice (Xôi)If you have been familiar with traveling around Vietnam, then sticky rice is maybe a common dish with a cheap price that everyone can easily afford. Sticky rice is just the dish for anyone, as long as you are hungry or simply having not figured out what to eat for breakfast, sticky rice may be a wise choice for a nutritious and cheap one. The special thing about Huế’s sticky rice is that there are hundreds of flavours and kinds that believe me, you should think beforehand on the way to the stall or else you will not even know what you will choose when you arrive there since every flavour has its own deliciousness. Pandanus, black bean, red bean or peanut sticky rice is people’s regular choice. However, there are also more expensive sticky rice dishes such as chicken sticky rice and pork pies sticky rice in more high-class restaurants.

[H4] Vegetarian Food
[P] It has been a long time ago when there is a custom of the East that people have to eat vegetarian food on some special occasions, especially those who follow Buddhism. However, nowadays, people still enjoy eating vegetarian food, even as their main course of the day. What makes the art of vegeterian food is that you do have the feeling of eating some kinds of meat while in fact, you are not eating meat at all! That is also the reason why so many people enjoy eating vegetarian food that much.

[H4] Desserts and Drinks
[P] I am sure your meal cannot be completed without delicious and yummy desserts and drinks. Although Huế is not so famous for its drinks and café, there are still many interesting places as well as palatable desserts that you can enjoy.
[P] Alleyway and Imperial Sweetened Porridges (Chè Hẻm và Chè Cung Đình)No need to say, chè hẻm is such a popular dish in Huế that no one has never once heard of this legendary and savoury dish. Though no big and slashing restaurant, no shiny sign or advertisement, Chè Hẻm still has its own distinctive feature to be distinguished with the common term “chè Huế”.  If you are finding a suitable and delicious dessert for your meal, chè hẻm is definitely what will make you fall in love by its sweetness.
