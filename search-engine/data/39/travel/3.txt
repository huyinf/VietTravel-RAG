This picturesque spot attracts numerous visitors. If you visit during the early or mid-month, you can witness the low tide in the afternoon, revealing a golden sandy beach and rocky formations leading to Hòn Yến. Visitors can stroll along the beach, climb the rocks, and enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, with fishermen's homes beneath tall coconut trees. At Hòn Yến, you can enjoy fresh seafood caught by local fishermen, such as anchovies, squid, 'lady's nipple' snails, and crabs, all at affordable prices. You can even try your hand at fishing for local species like 'bò' fish or 'dí' fish near the rocky pools, alongside lobster farming rafts. Afterward, sit under the shade of ancient banyan trees and enjoy grilled seafood or porridge. If you're in the mood, feel free to take a swim in the clear waters. Located next to a coastal village with soft, white sand beaches, Hòn Yến is now a popular destination for travelers. Here, you'll witness fishing boats docking early in the morning with fresh fish, visit the ancient Ông Nam Hải Temple that holds the spiritual beliefs of the fishermen, and enjoy the serene natural beauty surrounded by clear skies and waters.

Vung Ro Vung Ro is a small yet stunning bay located in Hoa Xuan Nam Commune, Dong Hoa District, Phu Yen Province, nestled right by the Deo Ca mountain range. It serves as a natural maritime boundary between Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa provinces. The bay spans 1,640 hectares of water and is deep enough to accommodate ships weighing over 5,000 tons. It is sheltered by the high mountains of Deo Ca, Da Bia, and Hon Ba, which protect it from the North, East, and West. Within the bay, there are several small beaches, such as Bai Lach, Bai Mu U, Bai Nga, Bai Chua, Bai Chan Trau, Bai Ho, Bai Chinh, Bai Bang, and Bai Lau. Da Bia, Vung Ro, and Deo Ca are notable historical, cultural, and tourist landmarks in Phu Yen. Visitors with more time can try fishing in the rock crevices or on the fish and shrimp farms of the local fishermen. Alternatively, they can hire a small motorboat from the locals to explore the bay or head out to Hon Nua Island for a secluded experience, swim in crystal-clear waters, and catch the first sunrise on the mainland of Vietnam. Looking north, you'll see the bustling Vung Ro Port with large cargo ships loading and unloading. In the distance, the towering Da Bia mountain stands proudly at 706 meters above sea level, offering a commanding view of the serene Vung Ro waters. Early mornings or late afternoons, the summit of Da Bia is often surrounded by white clouds, creating a mystical and ethereal atmosphere. Address: Hoa Xuan Nam Commune, Dong Hoa District, Phu Yen Province Vung Ro Bay 3. Bai Mon - Mui Dien Bai Mon - Mui Dien is one of Phu Yen's well-known tourist destinations, with the two sites located next to each other. Currently, Bai Mon - Mui Dien is situated in Dong Be Hamlet, Hoa Tam Commune, Dong Hoa District. Mui Dien is also known by other names such as Mui Dai Lanh or Mui Ke Ga. Bai Mon is shielded by Mui Nay to the north and Mui Dien to the south. The beach stretches about 400 meters. Whether you visit on a misty morning to watch the ocean or in the evening to see the sunset behind the mountains, this is a perfect spot for photos. The gentle beach, with its fine white sand, feels like walking through a fairy tale. The soft waves lapping the shore are like a romantic embrace, inviting you to immerse in nature's beauty. The beautiful Bai Mon – Mui Dien beach is a popular spot for tourists to unwind after a busy year. It is also a location for exciting water sports events that attract many visitors. One of the most enjoyable experiences is climbing to the top of the lighthouse, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the vast ocean. Spending the night here adds even more charm. You can indulge in delicious seafood, sing, and dance with friends and family under the stars. The sound of the waves complements the music, and the fresh, clean air offers a refreshing escape from the city. Address: Dong Be Hamlet, Hoa Tam Commune, Dong Hoa District, Phu Yen Province Bai Mon - Mui Dien 4. O Loan Lagoon O Loan Lagoon, O Loan Lagoon. The sky and water blend seamlessly, While the lagoon's surface reflects the wings of the crane. The cool breeze spreads, filling the air with beauty. The surrounding hills rise like embroidered tapestries, Shaded in hues of green and blue. Yams and cassava flourish in the breeze, While the sugarcane and corn fields stretch out, painting the landscape. (Xuân Diệu) From the Quán Cau Pass, the serene O Loan Lagoon can be seen, bordered by gently rolling hills and lush sugarcane fields. The view stretches to Mount Tu Bi, where a winding stream runs through narrow ravines before flowing into the lagoon, creating a picturesque scene. Surrounding the lagoon are Dong Chay Mountain, Cam Mountain, and An Hai Islet, with rocky outcrops reaching into the water. To the northwest of O Loan Lagoon, the golden sand beach stretches towards An Ninh Dong, accompanied by lush pine forests. To the north of the lagoon, there is an An Hai culinary area with bamboo huts on stilts, perfect for enjoying local delicacies like grouper, shrimp, crabs, squids, and jellyfish. The most famous dish is the O Loan blood cockle, which has a thick shell and sweet meat highly praised by both local and international visitors. Another local specialty is the oysters. The famous gourmet poet Tan Da, upon visiting Phu Yen, praised the oysters here by saying: “Phu Cau is known for its fish, and O Loan for its oysters.” The oysters attach to sharp-edged rocks and can be cooked in a variety of ways, but the best way to enjoy them is raw or mixed with peanuts and tomatoes. O Loan's famous crabs, especially the Huynh De crab, are known for their reddish or yellow shells. When the crabs are still alive, they have a tuft of golden hairs at the back. Interestingly, the Huynh De crab doesn't move sideways like other crabs but moves forward, with its claws and legs growing in front. Simply steaming the crab and dipping it in salt, pepper, and lime makes for an irresistible treat. Address: National Route 1A, An Hiep Commune, Tuy An District, Phu Yen Province O Loan Lagoon 5. Ghenh Da Dia Ghenh Da Dia Phu Yen is a stunning and famous landmark not only on the Vietnamese tourist map but also known internationally for its unique and majestic natural beauty. Ghenh Da Phu Yen is considered a fascinating tourist destination, combining the elements of rock, water, and the vast sky. Ghenh Da Dia is located in An Ninh Dong Commune, Tuy An District, Phu Yen Province. What makes it unique is the natural arrangement of large rocks that are either round or square-shaped, forming a striking scene as though they were purposely arranged by nature itself. Based on various surveys and studies, it is believed that around 200 million years ago, volcanic activity in the Vân Hòa plateau caused lava to flow into the sea. When the hot lava met the cold seawater, it solidified and cracked in a vertical pattern, resulting in the unique rock formations we see today. From a distance, the rock formations resemble a massive beehive, dark and rugged. Alternatively, they can be imagined as stacked discs, jumbled together like a brick kiln. The area is blessed by nature with a picturesque and serene landscape, blending mountains, water, and sky like a perfect watercolor painting. Ghenh Da Dia is a captivating wonder that continues to draw in visitors with its beauty. Address: An Ninh Dong Commune, Tuy An District, Phu Yen Province Ghenh Da Dia - Tuy An 6. Xuan Dai Bay Located along National Highway 1A, stretching about 50km along the East Coast from Song Cau town to Tuy An district in the northern part of Phu Yen province, Xuan Dai Bay unfolds like a beautiful watercolor painting. The bay is formed by a range of mountains that extend about 15km into the sea, resembling the head of a mythical unicorn. Three sides of the bay are enclosed by mountain ranges that stretch into the ocean. The rocky areas in contact with the sea have been shaped by the waves, creating unique formations. Few bays possess such diverse landscapes as Xuan Dai Bay —with cliffs connecting coves, coves leading to beaches, and beaches curving into mountains in a mesmerizing, continuous pattern. Within the bay, there are more than a dozen different coves, varying in size and depth. As the locals sing: “Vung La, Vung Xu, Vung Chao Vung Dong, Vung Mam, each cove is beloved.” Xuan Dai Bay is also historically significant, having witnessed a naval battle between the Tay Son army and the Nguyen dynasty. In 1832, a U.S. diplomatic mission carrying a letter from the President arrived here to meet with Nguyen Tri Phuong, the official appointed by Emperor Minh Mang, to establish “trade and friendship.” Xuan Dai Bay became the first point of contact between Vietnam and the United States, and for a long period, it served as the capital of Phu Yen province. Xuan Dai Bay is a breathtaking destination, enchanting countless visitors who come to Phu Yen. Within the bay’s pristine waters, visitors can enjoy the stunning natural scenery with long, clean beaches that are soft and pure. Address: National Highway 1A, Song Cau Town, Phu Yen Xuan Dai Bay 7. Mai Nha Island Cù lao Mái Nhà , also known as Robinson Island of Phu Yen, is famous for its pristine beauty, attracting many tourists today. Located about 27 km north of Tuy Hoa city, Phu Yen, this island retains its untouched charm, making it an ideal destination for those who enjoy exploration and adventure during the summer. It is one of the top places people choose when visiting Phu Yen. Cù lao Mái Nhà is located in An Hai commune, Tuy An district, Phu Yen province. Despite being not far from the mainland, it remains an intriguing spot to discover hidden natural beauty.

Vân Hòa Plateau Vân Hòa Plateau is the most famous plateau in Phu Yen, located in Son Hoa district, including the communes of Son Xuan, Son Long, and Son Dinh. Situated at an altitude of 400 meters, the plateau is characterized by bright sunshine, winds, and mist. The best time to visit Vân Hòa Plateau is during the Tet holiday, when wildflowers bloom along the roadsides, making the entire area look poetic and romantic. Visitors to the area will be stunned by the vast forests and numerous lakes and waterfalls. The air is fresh and cool, untouched by the pollution and noise of the city. With a climate similar to that of Da Lat but situated further south, Vân Hòa Plateau has become a favorite stop for adventure travelers. In addition to its stunning natural beauty, Vân Hòa is also a historic site. Landmarks such as the Uncle Ho Church and the Spring Hall were recognized as national historical sites in 2008 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism. Tourists visiting these sites can learn more about the eastern region of the majestic Truong Son mountain range. The climate here is cooler than Tuy Hoa's, especially in autumn when mist covers the Suoi Phan and Suoi Phen lakes. During the winter, the mist transforms the area into a serene, almost magical place. Because of this, Vân Hòa Plateau is often compared to Da Lat of Phu Yen. Address: Son Long Commune, Son Hoa District, Phu Yen Province Vân Hòa Plateau 9. Nhan Mountain Located right in Tuy Hoa city, with its natural beauty and cultural and architectural significance, Nhan Mountain is a must-see destination for visitors to Phu Yen province. The mountain lies north of the Da Rang River, standing about 60 meters above sea level, with a circumference of over 1 km, making it a prominent feature in Tuy Hoa city. Several local legends explain the name Nhan Mountain . Some say the mountain's shape resembles a crane with its wings spread, while others believe it was named after the cranes that once lived there. There are two ways to explore Nhan Mountain : you can either walk up the stone steps from the base to the summit or drive along the winding road. At the top, you'll find a 25-meter-high ancient Cham tower. The Nhan Tower has been recognized as a national architectural and artistic heritage site. From the summit of Nhan Mountain, you can enjoy panoramic views of Tuy Hoa city and the winding Da Rang River. With its beauty and rich historical and cultural value, Nhan Mountain is an unmissable destination for anyone visiting Phu Yen, the land of yellow flowers on green grass.

Phun Gorge If you have the chance to visit Phu Yen, make sure to witness the breathtaking beauty of Phun Gorge , a stunning natural wonder gifted to this land.

To reach it, follow National Highway 1A to Phu Lam Town, then take National Highway 29 towards the Black Rock mountains and head upstream to the Banh Lai River. You will be greeted with the majestic and cool beauty of the gorge. The surrounding nature seems to embrace Phun Gorge entirely. From a high vantage point, the gorge appears rugged and powerful, with steep cliffs and large boulders, creating a variety of unique shapes. The name 'Phun' comes from the geological formation, where hard rock layers above and softer layers below have eroded over time, creating a deep chasm. As the water rushes down from upstream, it splashes and froths, creating a misty, mystical atmosphere. Beyond the awe-inspiring scenery, visitors can enjoy activities like kayaking and rock climbing for adventure seekers.
