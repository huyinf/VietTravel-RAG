Dambri Waterfall Dambri Waterfall is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Lam Dong, widely known for its breathtaking beauty. The name 'Dambri' comes from the language of the K'Ho people, meaning 'waiting'. According to local legend, the waterfall is tied to a love story between a young woman and her beloved, a tale of deep and enduring love. Standing as the tallest waterfall in Lam Dong Province at over 40 meters high, Dambri creates a stunning cascade of water that is both awe-inspiring and majestic. The dramatic beauty of the waterfall has inspired many to visit and experience its power. There are three ways to reach the waterfall: a thrilling 1,650-meter long slide, a climb up 138 stairs, or a more relaxed elevator ride. The name Dambri has a rich connection to Central Highlands culture and is linked to a touching local legend. It tells the story of a poor young man named Dam and his love for H'Bi, a girl from a wealthy K'Ho family. Despite their deep love, H'Bi's father opposed the relationship, sending Dam far away without a return date. H'Bi waited for her lover, year after year, and often cried in the forest, mourning for him. Her tears eventually formed the Dambri waterfall, flowing relentlessly as a symbol of her undying love. The waterfall's name, 'Dambri', thus also means 'waiting'. During the rainy season, the water flows loudly, almost as if echoing the despair of H'Bi's cries for her lost love. The area surrounding the waterfall is covered in an untouched, wild forest of nearly 300 hectares, teeming with rare bird species and ancient trees such as sao, kèn kèn, and dối—some so large that they require multiple people to embrace their trunks.

Pongour Waterfall Pongour Waterfall , also known as Seven-Level Waterfall or Heavenly Waterfall, stands at 40 meters high and nearly 100 meters wide, cascading across seven distinct levels. It is the only waterfall in Lam Dong that hosts an annual festival on the 15th day of the first lunar month. During this time, various ethnic groups gather to celebrate with traditional games, music, and dance. The unique beauty of the waterfall lies in its series of flat stone steps, which, although irregularly arranged, break the water into hundreds of small streams, creating a dramatic display of white foamy waters. Beneath the falls lies a vast, tranquil lake with numerous stones scattered across its surface. Pongour Waterfall is deeply rooted in the local legend of the K’ho people. According to the story, this land was once ruled by a beautiful K’ho female chief named Kanai, who had the remarkable ability to tame wild animals. Among her loyal followers were four massive rhinoceroses that she commanded to clear the land, build dams, and protect the village. On the 15th day of the first lunar month, she passed away, and her four rhinoceroses stayed by her side until they too perished from grief. Shortly after, a stunning waterfall appeared where she had been laid to rest. The white, cool waters represent her flowing hair, while the large moss-covered stones forming the waterfall's base symbolize the rhinoceros horns. This legend is a symbol of eternal unity between the people and nature. Address: Tan Nghia Village, Ninh Gia, Duc Trong, Lam Dong Pongour Waterfall Datanla Waterfall 15.
