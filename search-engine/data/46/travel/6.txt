Shaun T Sydney, Australia 1,037 contributions 4 4 of 5 bubbles Highest Mountain Ba Den in Sth Vietnam Really enjoyed our day here with plenty to do.  We tried to take our 4 year old up the mountain but only got to the half way point given the climb and the steps... so will def come and do an adult climb. Plenty to do here between the alpine racer, multiple cable cars and temples as well as gardens to try and visit. To get the best out of the day... definitely best to come up the night before...

Soko37 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 15,269 contributions 3 5 of 5 bubbles New Buddha Statue The part of big Sun world complex with cable cars, restaurants, souvenirs and other attractions on the top of Black Virgin Mountain. If you hike like me you have problem to get inside on the top. It is close loop of system pay and go. Big Buddha is huge , very commercial but having great views around. Many people love it. Music, prayers, fountain show and many attractions around. As it is lately build, it is more commercial and less authentic Read more Review of: Big Buddha Black Virgin Mountain Written December 13, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Soko37 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 15,269 contributions 3 5 of 5 bubbles Easy hike on stairs For whole day trip to Black Virgin Mountain, you should not miss Hang Pagoda. Beside biggest attractions connected to mountain on the top which is very commercial this one is smaller and more authentic. You can walk on straits uphill up to one hour with easy way or taking cable car, if you spend whole day then you should buy combo ticket including lunch and few cable car rides. Good shoes, refreshments available on the way there Read more Review of: Hang Pagoda Written December 12, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Could be crowded in peak time, my weekday was empty and many small shops along were closed. It is touristic attraction for many decades, heading to Hang pagoda and temple 🛕. Could be managed when rains or wet as stairs are bigger. If not taking challenge then you buy ticket for cable car 🚠. You could visit other attractions on the top as part of Sunworld Read more Review of: Boi Loi Trail Written December 13, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Good shoes, snack, water and rain jacket as basic need. Easy way it takes between 2-3h. If you want to compete in rapid speed, you manage in one hours to challenge yourself. 40% incline average, ok run from bottom and supper challenging on the top when in line is more than 50%. When raining or wet, it is very slippery and super challenging. On the top there is big issue how to enter commercial Sunworld area with attractions. Really enjoyed, recommended. If tired take cable car down when you find entrance to park Read more Review of: Power Pole Trail Written December 16, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Soko37 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 15,269 contributions 3 4 of 5 bubbles Commercial part of Ba Den mountain Whole day trip to Black Virgin Mountain, cable car rides, Pagodas, religious places, souvenirs and nice views. System of pay and enjoy all attractions. It is not so authentic and bit overdone to attract people. I am not used to make Disney land from Mountain View, rather hike and enjoy nature but many people like it. Cable car to the top or round trip, you decide for best price after having plan you can see Big Buddha, Pagodas. When you hike up there there is challenge to get in Read more Review of: Sun World Black Virgin Mountain Written December 13, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
