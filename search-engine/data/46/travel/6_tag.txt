[LI] Shaun TSydney, Australia1,037 contributions44 of 5 bubblesHighest Mountain Ba Den in Sth VietnamReally enjoyed our day here with plenty to do.  We tried to take our 4 year old up the mountain but only got to the half way point given the climb and the steps... so will def come and do an adult climb. Plenty to do here between the alpine racer, multiple cable cars and temples as well as gardens to try and visit. To get the best out of the day... definitely best to come up the night before... Great day outRead moreReview of: Black Virgin MountainWritten April 11, 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Soko37Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam15,269 contributions35 of 5 bubblesNew Buddha StatueThe part of big Sun world complex with cable cars, restaurants, souvenirs and other attractions on the top of Black Virgin Mountain. If you hike like me you have problem to get inside on the top. It is close loop of system pay and go. Big Buddha is huge , very commercial but having great views around. Many people love it. Music, prayers, fountain show and many attractions around. As it is lately build, it is more commercial and less authenticRead moreReview of: Big Buddha Black Virgin MountainWritten December 13, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Soko37Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam15,269 contributions35 of 5 bubblesEasy hike on stairsFor whole day trip to Black Virgin Mountain, you should not miss Hang Pagoda. Beside biggest attractions connected to mountain on the top which is very commercial this one is smaller and more authentic. You can walk on straits uphill up to one hour with easy way or taking cable car, if you spend whole day then you should buy combo ticket including lunch and few cable car rides. Good shoes, refreshments available on the way thereRead moreReview of: Hang PagodaWritten December 12, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Soko37Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam15,269 contributions35 of 5 bubblesMany stairsFrom bottom to the top on stairs. Could be crowded in peak time, my weekday was empty and many small shops along were closed. It is touristic attraction for many decades, heading to Hang pagoda and temple 🛕. Could be managed when rains or wet as stairs are bigger. If not taking challenge then you buy ticket for cable car 🚠. You could visit other attractions on the top as part of SunworldRead moreReview of: Boi Loi TrailWritten December 13, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

[LI] Soko37Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam15,269 contributions35 of 5 bubblesExcellentExcellent hike for trained people.  Manageable for families with kids. Good shoes, snack, water and rain jacket as basic need. Easy way it takes between 2-3h. If you want to compete in rapid speed, you manage in one hours to challenge yourself. 40% incline average, ok run from bottom and supper challenging on the top when in line is more than 50%. When raining or wet, it is very slippery and super challenging. On the top there is big issue how to enter commercial Sunworld area with attractions. Really enjoyed, recommended. If tired take cable car down when you find entrance to parkRead moreReview of: Power Pole TrailWritten December 16, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

System of pay and enjoy all attractions. It is not so authentic and bit overdone to attract people. I am not used to make Disney land from Mountain View, rather hike and enjoy nature but many people like it. Cable car to the top or round trip, you decide for best price after having plan you can see Big Buddha, Pagodas. When you hike up there there is challenge to get inRead moreReview of: Sun World Black Virgin MountainWritten December 13, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
