Lady Chua Xiu Temple at Sam Mountain Lady Chua Xiu Temple at Sam Mountain is located at the foot of Sam Mountain, formerly part of Vĩnh Tế Commune, now within Núi Sam Ward in Châu Đốc City, An Giang Province, Vietnam. It is an important historical, architectural, and spiritual site for both the province and the region. The worship of Lady Chua Xiu is part of the Vietnamese Mother Worship belief. The Lady Chua Xiu Festival, celebrated annually from the 23rd to the 27th of April in the lunar calendar, has been recognized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism and the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism as a National Festival since 2001. Originally, the Lady Chua Xiu Temple was a humble structure made of bamboo and leaves, situated on the lowland area at the northwest foot of Sam Mountain, with its back to the mountainside and the main hall facing the road and the village fields. In 1870, the temple was rebuilt with bricks. In 1962, it was renovated with stone and ceramic tiles. In 1965, the temple’s guest house and fence were expanded. In 1972, the temple underwent significant reconstruction, completed in 1976, to achieve its current form. The intricate carvings in the main hall are strongly influenced by Indian art. High above, statues of gods stand strong and beautiful, holding up the roof beams. The doors and frames are finely carved and adorned with gold-leafed plaques and decorative panels. Notably, the back wall behind the statue of the Lady, along with the four columns of the old hall in front of the main temple, have been preserved. Today, the Lady Chua Xiu Temple is considered one of the largest temples in Vietnam. DETAILS: Address : Núi Sam Ward, Châu Đốc City, An Giang Province. Lady Chua Xiu Temple at Sam Mountain 3.

It is located in Vĩnh Tế Ward, now Núi Sam Ward, Châu Đốc City, An Giang Province, Vietnam.

It's unclear when exactly fish sauce became an essential part of the local diet, but it has since become a favorite ingredient among the people of the Southwestern region.

Soài So Lake covers an area of about 5 hectares, with a water capacity of approximately 400,000 cubic meters sourced from the high Bạc stream. The lake serves not only as an attractive tourist spot but also as a vital source of water for the region’s daily use and irrigation.

Located in the Tri Tôn and Tịnh Biên areas of An Giang, the lake sits at the foot of Mount Cấm and is also known as Stone Lake. The path to reach the lake is quite remote, so it is recommended to visit with a group. The lake is relatively small, surrounded by numerous slabs of silver stone in various sizes and shapes. Visitors can sit on these stones and dip their feet into the refreshing water. The water is so clear that you can see all the way to the bottom. This makes it the perfect backdrop for breathtaking photos, often featured in the most stunning 'selfie' shots. Latina Lake is located next to a road leading up to Mount Cấm, with fields of golden rice nearby, wildflower bushes in a variety of colors, and rocky outcrops in the distance. Immersing yourself in the natural beauty of this tranquil place, you’ll forget your worries and feel the relaxation you’ve been longing for.

Óc Eo Archaeological Site Óc Eo Archaeological Site is located in the Sập - Ba Thê Mountain region, Thoại Sơn District, An Giang Province. This vast historical site is closely linked to the remains of the Funan Kingdom, a powerful civilization in Southeast Asia that existed around 2,000 years ago. Visitors to Óc Eo will have the opportunity to explore and learn about this ancient culture. Many tourists traveling to An Giang take time to visit this fascinating archaeological site. Óc Eo Culture flourished in the Mekong Delta during the first ten centuries of the Common Era. According to Viet Fun Travel’s research, around the beginning of the Common Era, Óc Eo was a seaport connected to the Gulf of Thailand. It was strategically located along the maritime trade route between the Malay Peninsula and India, and the Mekong River and China, making it a major trade hub. Whether you visit An Giang in any season, don’t miss the chance to explore the Óc Eo Archaeological Site . This historical site, with its immense cultural significance, attracts numerous visitors, researchers, and archaeologists. In the 1920s, French archaeologist Louis Malleret used aerial photography to capture images of southern Vietnam. During his aerial survey, he discovered that the area around Ba Thê Mountain likely contained ancient artifacts. The name Óc Eo originally referred to a rectangular structure within the site, but Malleret later used it to describe the entire area. Subsequent archaeological studies revealed that traces of the Óc Eo civilization can be found in other regions such as Núi Sam, Lò Mo (An Giang), Nền Chùa, Cạnh Đền, Mốp Văn (Kiên Giang), and Gò Tháp (Đồng Tháp). DETAILS: Address: Óc Eo Town, Thoại Sơn District, An Giang Province. Óc Eo Archaeological Site 10.

The village is renowned for its traditional stilt houses, a signature of the riverside lifestyle. Much like other Cham villages such as An Khánh, An Bình, Sa Bâu, Châu Phong, and Đa Phước, Cham Village Châu Giang showcases a unique cultural heritage. What sets it apart, however, is the preservation of traditional practices under the shade of the mosque, making it an even more prominent example of Cham life. The village's stilt houses are a mesmerizing sight, adding to the area's charm. This captivating setting has inspired many writers, poets, and musicians, making it a popular muse in literature and the arts.

Mount Cô Tô offers various fascinating spots for visitors. One of its highlights is the Tức Dụp Hill (or Tức Chóp in Khmer), meaning 'water all year round'. Located on the western slope of Mount Cô Tô, it is approximately 18 kilometers from Tri Tôn town. Before 1975, this hill was famously referred to as the 'Two Million Dollar Hill' by the press, referencing the amount of American bombs that fell here, equivalent to millions of US dollars. This area served as a base for resisting American forces, with its labyrinth of rocky paths, sometimes wide, sometimes narrow, sometimes steep, and large caves that once served as the base's headquarters, weapons storage, living quarters, clinic, and a hall that could accommodate up to 150 people. Mount Cô Tô is a perfect spot to watch the sunset. From here, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Tri Tôn District and the nearby Cambodian border, with rolling hills, vast rice fields, and the picturesque plots of land cultivated by the Khmer people. Mount Cô Tô doesn’t have a specific address on the map like a city building or restaurant. However, given its massive size, it’s easy to spot from a distance. If you're starting from Long Xuyên, take Provincial Road 943 towards Núi Sập Town. From here, asking locals for directions to Mount Cô Tô is easy. Alternatively, you can take other routes that lead to the mountain, but the 943 road offers a more scenic experience.
