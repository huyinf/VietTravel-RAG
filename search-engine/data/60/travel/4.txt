Windmill Field in Bạc Liêu Heading from Bạc Liêu City towards the sea on Cao Văn Lầu road, in the coastal area of Đông A hamlet, Vĩnh Trạch Đông commune, you'll find the Bạc Liêu wind power plant. The windmill field is approximately 20km from the city center, yet even from a distance of several kilometers, you can see the turbine columns spinning like giant pinwheels. This field boasts a total of 62 wind turbines, each tower standing at 80m, with a diameter of 4m and weighing over 200 tons. Constructed from stainless steel, the 42m-long blades are made of special plastic and can fold in bad weather to prevent damage.

Nhà Mát Tourist Area Nhà Mát tourist area in Bạc Liêu has become a familiar destination for travelers in recent years. Also known as the “Mekong Delta's Fairy Stream,” visitors can relax and immerse themselves in the azure waves, giving the feeling of being at sea. The first impressive sight for visitors is the entrance gate of the beach area designed with an octopus lifting a boat, which is quite picturesque.

The house, designed by a French engineer, used all materials imported from France, making it the most majestic mansion in the southern provinces at that time.

Formerly, this conservation area was a mangrove swamp near the sea with a diverse and rich natural saltwater ecosystem. However, due to natural sedimentation, this mangrove area is gradually moving away from the sea, leaving only a part that forms the bird sanctuary as seen today. The saltwater mangrove ecosystem covers an area of over 385ha, serving as the habitat and nesting grounds for various plants, birds, frogs, etc. Bird Sanctuary Bạc Liêu is the habitat for many plant and animal species (Photo by ST) The bird sanctuary always brings surprising moments to visitors. Upon entering, you'll witness the lively scene of a natural birdyard, with bird eggs scattered on the ground like white pearls. The most fascinating experience is standing atop a tall observation tower made from tree trunks, leisurely admiring the spectacle of flocks of birds flying back to their nests in the evening. The orderly flight of different bird species creates a captivating display in the sky. Diverse ecosystem in Bạc Liêu Bird Sanctuary (Photo by ST) 5. Vĩnh Hưng Ancient Tower Located approximately 20km from the city center of Bạc Liêu, Vĩnh Hưng Ancient Tower is situated in Vĩnh Hưng A commune, Vĩnh Lợi district. It is the only preserved ancient architectural relic in the western region, discovered by a French archaeologist in 1911. Vĩnh Hưng Tower was built with a relatively simple and rustic structure on a spacious piece of land, elevated 50cm above the rice fields.

The tower's entrance faces west, and inside, there is a rectangular-shaped room with a straight-standing thick wall and a vaulted roof. Through multiple excavations, archaeologists discovered various artifacts such as a bronze deity's hand, a stone statue of a goddess, a green stone statue of a goddess, a bronze Buddha head, etc. However, visitors today won't see these ancient artifacts, as a new set of linga and yoni made of stone has been placed instead.

Bạc Liêu Sea Far from glamorous and extravagant, unlike the pristine white sandy beaches of Vũng Tàu or Nha Trang, Bạc Liêu's coastline maintains a raw, untouched beauty. It features expansive sandy stretches along with mudflats that bring forth the fresh and vibrant seafood specialties of the coastal region. With 156km of coastline and key estuaries like Gành Hào, Nhà Mát, Cái Cùng, the Bạc Liêu Sea is surrounded by clusters of mangrove trees, fishing boats swaying in the wind, and coconut trees glistening in the breeze.

The eateries along the coast are tranquil, with no blaring music; the lights provide sufficient brightness without being flashy, gently flickering in hues of green and red. Travelers can also stroll across the concrete bridge spanning the Nhà Mát area offshore, experiencing a sensation of swaying as if riding on the back of ocean waves. Bạc Liêu Seaside (Photo by ST) 7. Western-style Architectural Ensemble Differing from some other provinces and cities, Bạc Liêu still boasts numerous mansions and villas built in Western architectural style in Bạc Liêu town. In the Hàng Me Park, there are many splendid structures, including administrative offices, a courthouse, a governor's mansion, and the Trạch Council House. This Western-style architectural ensemble is constructed using various building materials such as cast iron, doors, marble flooring, and bricks—all imported from France.

Hence, the Western-style architectural ensemble in Bạc Liêu exudes a distinctive charm, quite unlike the French villas in Hanoi, Saigon, Dalat, and elsewhere. Modern-designed houses (Photo by ST) 8. Xiêm Cán Pagoda Located in Hiệp Thành commune, this is one of the largest and most beautiful Khmer pagodas in the Khmer temple system in the South. Xiêm Cán Pagoda embraces the Angkor architecture of the Cambodian people, evident in unique patterns on the roof, walls, columns, and staircases. Today, one can feel the flourishing and distinctive cultural essence of the Khmer people, steadily preserved and enhanced to beautify, enrich, and diversify Vietnamese culture.

Ancient Litchi Garden Situated in the areas of Hiệp Thành and Vĩnh Trạch Đông, belonging to Bạc Liêu city, this unique ancient litchi garden stands unparalleled in the Mekong Delta region. The garden hosts hundreds of litchi trees, each bearing twisted and peculiar trunks, displaying a profound sense of time. The generous nature has endowed Bạc Liêu with fertile alluvial land near the sea, making it a favorable environment for two litchi varieties, Su-bic and Tu-huyt, which immigrated from China, rooted and thrived for centuries. Ancient litchi tree roots (Photo by ST) In the past, this litchi garden yielded an average of 300-400kg per tree per harvest annually. However, with the aging and degeneration of the trees, some garden owners have shifted their focus to turning the litchi garden into a tourist attraction. Nowadays, the number of visitors to the litchi garden has been increasing due to the refreshing atmosphere and the fragrant aroma of litchi. It's a delightful experience to lie under the ancient litchi trees, swaying gently in the breeze from the sea, immersing in the sweet fragrance of litchi, and letting the soul wander into the beautiful nature. During the ripe litchi season, visitors can also enjoy delicious, flavorful litchis, straight from the orchard. Singing 'Dạ Cổ' beneath the ancient litchi trees (Photo by ST) 10. Tắc Sậy Church Tắc Sậy Church stands as one of the remarkable attractions in Bạc Liêu province. This place is closely tied to touching stories about the life of Father Trương Bửu Diệp, who made significant contributions to the Catholic followers in this region. The church features a unique and distinctive architecture with three floors: the ground floor serves as a resting place, while the second and third floors are dedicated to holy masses with a spacious front hall.
