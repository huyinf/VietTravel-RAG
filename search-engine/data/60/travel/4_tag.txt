[H3] 4. Bạc Liêu Bird Garden
[P] Bạc Liêu Bird Sanctuary, located in Hiệp Thành commune, approximately 6km from Bạc Liêu city. Formerly, this conservation area was a mangrove swamp near the sea with a diverse and rich natural saltwater ecosystem. However, due to natural sedimentation, this mangrove area is gradually moving away from the sea, leaving only a part that forms the bird sanctuary as seen today. The saltwater mangrove ecosystem covers an area of over 385ha, serving as the habitat and nesting grounds for various plants, birds, frogs, etc.

The orderly flight of different bird species creates a captivating display in the sky.

[H3] 5. Vĩnh Hưng Ancient Tower
[P] Located approximately 20km from the city center of Bạc Liêu, Vĩnh Hưng Ancient Tower is situated in Vĩnh Hưng A commune, Vĩnh Lợi district.

[P] The tower is located near the eastern edge of the land strip, with a rectangular base. The tower's entrance faces west, and inside, there is a rectangular-shaped room with a straight-standing thick wall and a vaulted roof. Through multiple excavations, archaeologists discovered various artifacts such as a bronze deity's hand, a stone statue of a goddess, a green stone statue of a goddess, a bronze Buddha head, etc. However, visitors today won't see these ancient artifacts, as a new set of linga and yoni made of stone has been placed instead.

[H3] 6. Bạc Liêu Sea
[P] Far from glamorous and extravagant, unlike the pristine white sandy beaches of Vũng Tàu or Nha Trang, Bạc Liêu's coastline maintains a raw, untouched beauty. It features expansive sandy stretches along with mudflats that bring forth the fresh and vibrant seafood specialties of the coastal region. With 156km of coastline and key estuaries like Gành Hào, Nhà Mát, Cái Cùng, the Bạc Liêu Sea is surrounded by clusters of mangrove trees, fishing boats swaying in the wind, and coconut trees glistening in the breeze.

[P] Here, visitors can surrender themselves in the beachfront homes, savor seafood, and breathe in the invigorating sea breeze. The eateries along the coast are tranquil, with no blaring music; the lights provide sufficient brightness without being flashy, gently flickering in hues of green and red. Travelers can also stroll across the concrete bridge spanning the Nhà Mát area offshore, experiencing a sensation of swaying as if riding on the back of ocean waves.

[H3] 7. Western-style Architectural Ensemble
[P] Differing from some other provinces and cities, Bạc Liêu still boasts numerous mansions and villas built in Western architectural style in Bạc Liêu town. In the Hàng Me Park, there are many splendid structures, including administrative offices, a courthouse, a governor's mansion, and the Trạch Council House. This Western-style architectural ensemble is constructed using various building materials such as cast iron, doors, marble flooring, and bricks—all imported from France.

[H3] 9. Ancient Litchi Garden
[P] Situated in the areas of Hiệp Thành and Vĩnh Trạch Đông, belonging to Bạc Liêu city, this unique ancient litchi garden stands unparalleled in the Mekong Delta region. The garden hosts hundreds of litchi trees, each bearing twisted and peculiar trunks, displaying a profound sense of time. The generous nature has endowed Bạc Liêu with fertile alluvial land near the sea, making it a favorable environment for two litchi varieties, Su-bic and Tu-huyt, which immigrated from China, rooted and thrived for centuries.

[P] In the past, this litchi garden yielded an average of 300-400kg per tree per harvest annually. However, with the aging and degeneration of the trees, some garden owners have shifted their focus to turning the litchi garden into a tourist attraction. Nowadays, the number of visitors to the litchi garden has been increasing due to the refreshing atmosphere and the fragrant aroma of litchi. It's a delightful experience to lie under the ancient litchi trees, swaying gently in the breeze from the sea, immersing in the sweet fragrance of litchi, and letting the soul wander into the beautiful nature. During the ripe litchi season, visitors can also enjoy delicious, flavorful litchis, straight from the orchard.
