        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to remove any non-essential text, icons, and irrelevant content from the provided Vietnamese article, then translate the remaining content into Vietnamese. Wait, hold on\u2014the original is already in Vietnamese, and the user is asking to translate it into Vietnamese? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the instruction. Wait, looking again, the original is in Vietnamese, and the user wants to clean it up (remove useless text, icons, preserve readable characters) and then translate it to Vietnamese. But since it's already in Vietnamese, perhaps they meant to translate it into English? Maybe a mistranslation in their request. Alternatively, they might want to just clean up the existing Vietnamese content without translation. The user's query says \"translate this content to Vietnamese,\" but the content is in Vietnamese. That's a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal instruction: \"remove useless text, unrelated to the content, remove icons, just preserve readable and renderable characters and translate this content to vietnamese:\"\n\nAh, so the content provided is in Vietnamese, but the user wants to clean it up (removing non-content elements) and then translate it to Vietnamese, which is the same language. That seems redundant. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the user intended to have the content translated into English but made a typo. Or maybe they want the cleaned-up Vietnamese content without any translation. Alternatively, the user might be referring to translating from another language into Vietnamese, but the given content is already in Vietnamese.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the source content has some non-Vietnamese elements that need removal, and the user wants to ensure it's in clean Vietnamese. Let me check the provided content.\n\nLooking at the provided content: It's in Vietnamese with some HTML-like tags (H1, P, LI, etc.), URLs, and mentions of images like @Shutterstock. The user wants to remove icons (which may refer to image placeholders or emojis not present here) and any non-readable characters. So the task is to clean up the Vietnamese text by removing the tags (like [H1], [P], @Shutterstock references), any irrelevant sections (like the hotel listings, partner sections, follow-us links, etc.), and preserve only the main content about the tourist spots in Nam Dinh. Then, since the user says \"translate this content to Vietnamese,\" but it's already in Vietnamese, perhaps they want the cleaned-up version in Vietnamese without translation? Maybe there was a mistake in the instruction. Alternatively, the user might have meant \"preserve readable and renderable characters\" and ensure it's in Vietnamese, possibly cleaning up any formatting issues.\n\nAssuming that the user wants the content cleaned of unnecessary elements (tags, image credits, sections like \"Danh s\u00e1ch c\u00e1c kh\u00e1ch s\u1ea1n ch\u1ea5t l\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u1edf Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh\", \"M\u1ed9t s\u1ed1 l\u01b0u \u00fd khi du l\u1ecbch Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh\", \"T\u1ed5ng k\u1ebft\", and all the footer sections with links, payment partners, etc.), and then presented in a readable Vietnamese format. The translation part might be a confusion since it's already in Vietnamese.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Remove all HTML-like tags ([H1], [P], [LI], etc.).\n2. Remove image credits like @Shutterstock, @nguoinamdinh.vn, etc.\n3. Remove URLs and any hyperlinks.\n4. Remove sections unrelated to the main tourist spots, like hotel listings, tips, conclusion, follow-us, partners, etc.\n5. Keep only the sections describing the 10 tourist attractions in Nam Dinh.\n6. Ensure the remaining content is clean, without markdown or special formatting.\n7. The user mentioned \"translate to Vietnamese,\" but since it's already in Vietnamese, perhaps it's about ensuring proper Vietnamese language without any extra text, so no translation needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the cleaned Vietnamese text translated into another language, but the instruction says \"translate to Vietnamese.\" Given the ambiguity, but since the original content is in Vietnamese, and the output is supposed to be Vietnamese, the logical conclusion is that the user wants the text cleaned and presented in proper Vietnamese without any extraneous content.\n\nSo proceeding with that approach: the answer will be the cleaned-up Vietnamese content of the tourist spots, removing all the non-essential parts like hotels, footer sections, image credits, etc. Let's go through the content and extract only the attractions:\n\n1. \u0110\u1ec1n Tr\u1ea7n Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh\n2. Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd H\u01b0ng Ngh\u0129a\n3. Bi\u1ec3n Th\u1ecbnh Long\n4. Ru\u1ed9ng mu\u1ed1i B\u1ea1ch Long\n5. H\u1ed3 V\u1ecb Xuy\u00ean\n6. Th\u00e1p Ph\u1ed5 Minh\n7. C\u1eeda Ba L\u1ea1t\n8. Khu ph\u1ed1 c\u1ed5 Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh\n9. B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng D\u1ec7t\n\nWait, the original title says \"Kh\u00e1m ph\u00e1 10 \u0111\u1ecba \u0111i\u1ec3m\" but the content lists 9? Let's check:\n\nLooking back, in the Content with tags, after the first H1, it mentions \"9 \u0111\u1ecba \u0111i\u1ec3m tham quan n\u1ed5i ti\u1ebfng\". But the title says 10. Possibly an error in the original. Regardless, we need to list all the attractions mentioned.\n\nAlso, after each attraction's description, there's a line with an image credit like \"@Shutterstock\" which needs removal.\n\nAdditionally, after the attractions, there are sections about hotels, which should be removed. So the final cleaned content will include each of the H1 sections for the attractions, their descriptions, but no images, credits, or other elements. Also, ensuring that any hyperlinks or promotional text (like \"Xem gi\u00e1\") are removed.\n\nSo, removing all the hotel listings, the \"Danh s\u00e1ch c\u00e1c kh\u00e1ch s\u1ea1n\", \"M\u1ed9t s\u1ed1 l\u01b0u \u00fd\", \"T\u1ed5ng k\u1ebft\", and all footer content, and cleaning up the tourist spots' descriptions by removing image credits and tags. Then, present them in clean Vietnamese without any markdown. The titles will be the H1s, and the paragraphs underneath each as the content.\n"
